## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Pre-Deployment
1. ✅ Configure Telegram alerts (optional):
   - Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
   - Set `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`

2. ✅ Review cost dashboard weekly:
   - `python3 scripts/cost_dashboard.py`

3. ✅ Monitor SLO watchdog:
   - Runs automatically
   - Auto-rollback if latency > 150ms

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor first 100 user signups
2. Review partner conversions weekly
3. Process monthly payouts:
   - `python3 scripts/stripe_connect_payouts.py`

### Scaling Thresholds
- 100 users: Review autoscale settings
- 1,000 users: Consider PostgreSQL migration
- 10,000 users: Multi-region deployment
