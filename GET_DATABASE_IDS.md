# 🔍 How to Get Your Notion Database IDs

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Open Each Database in Notion

Go to your Notion workspace and open each of these databases:
- ⚙️ **Automation Queue System** (or the database inside it)
- 🔁 **Automation Log** 
- 📘 **EchoPilot Job Log**

### 2. Copy the Database ID from the URL

When you have a database open, look at your browser's address bar. The URL will look like this:

```
https://www.notion.so/yourworkspace/Database-Name-1a2b3c4d5e6f7890abcdef1234567890?v=...
                                                   ↑________________↑
                                            This is your Database ID
```

**The Database ID is the 32-character code** (letters and numbers) between the database name and `?v=`

### 3. What to Copy:

For each database, copy **ONLY** the 32-character alphanumeric code.

**Example:**
- ✅ Correct: `14f4b2c89a5d4e1ab23c56789def0123`
- ❌ Wrong: `Automation Queue System`
- ❌ Wrong: The full URL

### 4. Share Them With Me:

Once you have all three IDs, paste them here in this format:

```
Queue: [paste 32-character ID]
Log: [paste 32-character ID]
Job: [paste 32-character ID]
```

## 🎯 Once I Have the IDs:

I will:
1. Update all configuration files
2. Replace the demo placeholders
3. Get your bot ready to deploy

**It takes about 30 seconds once I have the real IDs!** 🚀
