Correct approach — keep everything 100% production-grade on zero extra cost.
Here’s your next stage plan (Day 2 → Day 3 transition) tuned for free-tier perfection:


---

✅ 1. Lock in Cloudflare (Free-Tier Optimization)

Goal: same practical security as paid WAF without cost.

Do now

1. Keep Full (Strict) TLS, Always Use HTTPS, and Browser Integrity Check = ON.


2. Under Security → Bots, turn on Bot Fight Mode.


3. Under Security → WAF → Custom Rules, add:

Expression: (http.request.uri.path contains "/api/" and not ip.src in {your-office-ip})
Action: Block

This gives basic endpoint protection without WAF billing.


4. Keep your rate-limit rule active (verified working).




---

✅ 2. Confirm Edge → Origin Path

Run:

curl -sI https://levqor.ai | grep -E "server|cf-ray|cache"

Expected:
server: cloudflare and cf-ray: → proves proxy active.
If that’s correct, Cloudflare is officially protecting your stack.


---

✅ 3. Harden Vercel + Backend

Frontend

Keep force-dynamic + no-store headers in place.

Add robots.txt → Disallow: /api/

Add favicon + metadata to improve trust.


Backend

Verify /api/intelligence/status returns "version": "v8.0-burnin".

Keep logging + correlation ID tracking running.



---

✅ 4. Secure Access Layer

Since you’re staying free-tier:

Finish 2FA on all six platforms (one-time setup).

Rotate any old tokens (> 90 days).

Store secrets only in Replit’s secret vault or GitHub Actions secrets.



---

✅ 5. Monitoring & Burn-In (Day 3)

Tomorrow at 09:00 UTC run:

./scripts/daily_burnin_check.sh

Confirm:

Uptime ≥ 99.98 %

Error rate ≤ 0.5 %

Cost ≤ $10/day Document in DAY-3-MONITORING-REPORT.md.



---

✅ 6. Presentation Polish (Optional but free)

Add favicon + meta description for SEO.

Create /humans.txt and /security.txt (professional touch).

Use Cloudflare Analytics → Performance tab → verify load < 1 s.



---

✅ Summary Table

Area	Status	Next Step

Cloudflare	Active (Free)	Custom rule + Bot Fight Mode
TLS/HTTPS	✅ Full Strict	Maintain
Rate-limit	✅ Working	Keep
2FA	⏳ Pending	Finish today
Backup	✅ Verified	Next weekly backup
Monitoring	✅ Auto	Run Day 3 script

When this list is complete, you’ll have a zero-cost hardened perimeter, clean 99.99 % uptime, and audit-ready posture — the perfect pre-revenue configuration for scaling safely.
