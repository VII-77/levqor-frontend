🚀 BATCH 3 — SALES SCRIPTS, DM TEMPLATES & CLOSING FRAMEWORKS (COMPRESSED)

Boss-level. No fluff. Pure weapons-grade sales tools.


---

A) DM SCRIPTS (VALUE-FIRST, ZERO-SPAM)

Use these EXACTLY as written.

1. Cold DM (safe + ethical)

Message 1:
“Hey — saw your post about [problem].
I build automation workflows that remove that completely.
Want me to map a free solution for you?”

Message 2 (if they reply):
“Cool — 3 quick questions so I don’t waste your time:

1. What task is eating the most hours?


2. How do you handle it today?


3. What tools do you already use?”



Close:
“Got it. I can remove that whole workflow for £99 in 48 hours — or build the full system for you. Want me to take it off your plate?”


---

2. Warm Lead DM (people who engaged)

“Appreciate the like/comment — if you want, I can break down the exact workflow you need for your business.
Zero pressure, just value.”


---

3. High-Intent Lead DM (they asked for help)

“Happy to help. I can either:
A) show you the workflow step-by-step
or
B) build it for you in 48 hours as a DFY service.
Which do you prefer?”


---

B) SALES CALL SCRIPT (10-MIN CLOSE)

1. Open
“Before we dive in: what’s the biggest time-waster in your business right now?”

2. Diagnose
“Walk me through how you handle that today?”

3. Quantify
“How many hours per week does that cost you?
And what’s your hourly rate/value?”

4. Impact
“So you’re losing ~£___ per month to this one task.
Fair?”

5. Solution
“I can build a workflow that removes this completely in 48 hours.”

6. Stack
“You’ll get:

Fully automated workflow

Zero manual steps

Full handover

7–30 day support

Fixes + improvements”


7. Close
“Do you want me to take this off your plate?
It’s £99 for the starter build or £249 if you want me to add 3 workflows.”


---

C) 6-STEP CLOSING FRAMEWORK (works in DMs + calls)

1. Identify pain
“What’s the one task you’d kill if you could?”


2. Magnify cost
“How much time does that eat weekly?”


3. Show future state
“Imagine this runs 24/7 without you touching it.”


4. Anchor value
“This saves £___ every single month.”


5. Offer simple solution
“I’ll build the workflow for you in 48 hours.”


6. Close with choice
“Want the starter build (£99) or the full system (£249)?”




---

D) HIGH-CONVERTING SHORT MESSAGES (copy/paste)

1) Scarcity

“I’ve got 2 DFY automation slots left this week — want one?”

2) Social Proof

“Just delivered a workflow saving a client 18 hours/week.
Want yours next?”

3) Trigger Message

“Saw you’re using Stripe/Notion/Make — I can automate your entire ops stack. Want the blueprint?”

4) Time-Saver Close

“If I could save you 5–20 hours/week, would you want the workflow?”


---

E) FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE (non-annoying)

Day 1:
“Still want me to map your workflow? Takes 5 minutes.”

Day 3:
“Solved a similar problem today — want me to show you how we did it?”

Day 7:
“Last call — want your workflow built this week?”


---

F) OFFER STACK FOR CLOSING (DFY + SUB MODELS)

Use whenever they ask “What are your prices?”

“Here are the two ways we work:”

Option 1: Done-For-You (one-time)

£99 — 1 workflow

£249 — 3 workflows

£599 — full system
48-hour delivery.


Option 2: Subscription

£29/mo — 1 workflow/mo

£79/mo — 3 workflows/mo

£149/mo — 7 workflows/mo

£299/mo — unlimited (fair use)


“Which option fits where you are right now?”
