# PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI AGENT

You are updating Levqor Genesis v8.0 so that ALL visible pricing and ALL Stripe prices are perfectly aligned for launch.

GOAL
- Make the entire system use ONE consistent price table:
  - STARTER: £29/month
  - PRO: £49/month
  - GROWTH: £79/month
  - (Keep DFY tiers as currently configured unless explicitly changed.)
- Ensure that:
  - Website text = these prices
  - Stripe Checkout sessions = these prices
  - Stripe price IDs used by the backend match the new values
  - No hidden “£19” anywhere.

RULES
- DO NOT create new Stripe products.
- Only adjust which Stripe **price IDs** the backend uses (env vars) OR, if already correct, update the marketing copy to match.
- DO NOT touch webhook logic, database models, or monitoring.
- Verify every change with REAL checks, NOT assumptions.
- Use existing secrets and integrations; do not create new secrets.

STEPS

1) DISCOVER CURRENT TRUTH
- Search the repo for all references to:
  - STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER
  - STRIPE_PRICE_PRO
  - STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH
- Open the Stripe health report file (STRIPE-CHECK-ENDPOINT-REPORT.md or similar) and confirm:
  - The current GBP amounts for each price ID.
- Summarise in comments:
  - Which env var maps to which Stripe price ID and amount.

2) SYNC BACKEND TO NEW PRICES
- If the Stripe prices themselves are already set to 29/49/79:
  - Leave env vars alone.
- If they are set to 19/49/79 etc:
  - DO NOT change code.
  - Instead:
    - Note in comments that backend still uses 19 for starter.
    - We will later update Stripe itself manually via dashboard.
- Confirm that:
  - /api/billing/checkout uses these env vars and nothing hard-coded.

3) SYNC FRONTEND TEXT
- Search the frontend (levqor-site) for “£19”, “19/mo”, “29/mo”, “49/mo”, “79/mo”.
- Update all visible pricing copy across:
  - /pricing
  - /dfy
  - any other marketing pages that show prices
- Ensure:
  - Starter: text shows “£29 / month”
  - Pro: “£49 / month”
  - Growth: “£79 / month”
- Also update any FAQ answers or comparison tables that mention specific numbers.

4) VERIFY CHECKOUT WIRING
- Find the components that call the checkout endpoint, e.g.:
  - /pricing CTA buttons
  - /dfy CTA buttons
- Confirm that:
  - Starter button on pricing page → calls /api/billing/checkout with plan=starter
  - Pro button → plan=pro
  - Growth button → plan=growth
- Confirm the backend handler maps these plan values to the correct env vars.
- DO NOT change the endpoint path or method (must stay POST).

5) RUN REAL CHECKS
After code changes:

- Restart backend.
- Run these commands in the shell and paste results into comments:

  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://api.levqor.ai/health
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://api.levqor.ai/api/stripe/check
  curl -s https://www.levqor.ai/pricing | grep -E "£29|29/mo|29 per month" | head
  curl -s https://www.levqor.ai/pricing | grep -E "£19|19/mo|19 per month" | head

- Confirm:
  - Both API endpoints return 200.
  - Pricing page shows 29, 49, 79.
  - Pricing page does NOT show 19 anywhere.

6) STRIPE DASHBOARD MANUAL NOTE (for owner)
- In a short markdown file LEVQOR-PRICING-SYNC-NOTES.md at repo root, write:
  - Which Stripe price IDs correspond to Starter/Pro/Growth.
  - For each, the GBP amount.
  - A note: “If Stripe amounts differ from website copy (29/49/79), update them in Stripe Dashboard → Products → Prices, not in code.”

DO NOT
- Do not touch webhooks, database schema, or monitoring.
- Do not change DFY prices unless they are clearly inconsistent in text vs Stripe.
- Do not add new dependencies.

When done, summarise:
- Whether backend amounts and frontend text now match.
- Any place where Stripe Dashboard still needs manual price adjustment.
