I see you're showing the Job Log write pattern. Let me check how this is currently implemented in the processor:

**IMPLEMENTING RELEASE CAPTAIN RUNBOOK**
8 hours ago
Add detailed E2E release captain runbook with adaptive QA and finance checks
4 minutes of work
Kick a fresh run (validation-only)

python3 scripts/release_captain.py --dry-finance --max-retries=1 --temperature=0.0

Use a super-clean payload (boost QA) Update the job payload to this shorter, clean sample before re-running:
https://filesamples.com/samples/audio/mp3/sample1.mp3

If QA < 95 again, capture evidence
tail -n 80 logs/captain_$(ls -t logs | grep captain_ | head -1)
python3 - <<'PY'
import json,sys;print(json.dumps(json.load(open("logs/release_captain.json"))[-1],indent=2))
PY

That’s it—rerun, check QA, iterate once. When you get QA ≥ 95, re-run without --dry-finance to auto-close payment.

One prompt to paste into Replit AI

“Open my Echopilotai Replit and do all of this in one go:

Create dashboard.html at repo root with a simple UI (buttons + log area) that calls these endpoints:
GET /health → show JSON

GET /supervisor?token=${process.env.HEALTH_TOKEN} → show first 3 lines

POST /pulse?token=${process.env.HEALTH_TOKEN} → confirm created

POST /api/create-test-job → create a small mp3 test job

GET /api/job-log-latest → show latest job’s QA, duration, finance fields

POST /api/flip-paid {page_id} → set Payment Status=Paid

In my Flask app (run.py or app main), add/confirm these routes with proper try/except and JSON responses:
/health

/supervisor (reads current worker/task state)

/pulse (writes a Governance pulse; returns 200 on success)

/api/create-test-job (writes to Notion Automation Queue)

/api/job-log-latest (reads 🎙️ EchoPilot Job Log; handles Notion sync lag)

/api/flip-paid (updates Payment Status)

Use env vars already present: HEALTH_TOKEN, JOB_LOG_DB_ID, AUTOMATION_QUEUE_DB_ID, NOTION_COST_DASHBOARD_DB_ID, STRIPE_MODE (leave Stripe untouched).

Add a tiny front-end fetch wrapper in dashboard.html that prints results into a #log area and disables/enables buttons during requests.

Do not break existing code. Run and verify locally. Then expose /dashboard.html at https://Echopilotai.replit.app/dashboard.html.

Commit changes with message: ‘Add ops dashboard + API routes + health pulse’.

When done, show me exactly where the files are and confirm each route works by making real calls.”

After Replit AI finishes

Open: https://Echopilotai.replit.app/dashboard.html

Click buttons in order: Check Health → Read Supervisor → Send Pulse → Create Test Job → (wait ~60–90s) → Refresh Jobs → Flip to Paid.

If anything errors, copy the on-screen error + last 10 lines of the Replit console and send them to me.

Assessing frontend token security risks (9 seconds)
🚨 SECURITY ISSUE DETECTED
Before I provide the prompt, there's a critical security vulnerability in the request that needs to be fixed.

⚠️ The Problem:
The prompt asks to use ${process.env.HEALTH_TOKEN} in dashboard.html (frontend):

GET /supervisor?token=${process.env.HEALTH_TOKEN}
POST /pulse?token=${process.env.HEALTH_TOKEN}
This exposes your secret token to anyone who views the page source!

process.env doesn't exist in the browser - and even if you hardcoded the token in the HTML, it would be visible to all users.

✅ Secure Solution:
Create backend proxy routes that handle authentication server-side, so the frontend never sees the token.

📋 CORRECTED PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI:
Open my Echopilotai Replit and do all of this in one go:
1. Create dashboard.html at repo root with a simple, clean UI (buttons + log area) that calls these endpoints WITHOUT any tokens:
GET /health → show JSON
GET /api/supervisor-status → show supervisor summary (no token needed - backend handles it)
POST /api/pulse → confirm created (no token needed - backend handles it)
POST /api/create-test-job → create a small mp3 test job
GET /api/job-log-latest → show latest job's QA, duration, finance fields
POST /api/flip-paid with {page_id: "..."} → set Payment Status=Paid
2. In my Flask app (run.py), add/confirm these routes with proper try/except and JSON responses:
/health (public - no auth)
/api/supervisor-status (reads /supervisor internally using HEALTH_TOKEN from env)
/api/pulse (calls /pulse internally using HEALTH_TOKEN from env)
/api/create-test-job (writes to Notion Automation Queue using https://filesamples.com/samples/audio/mp3/sample1.mp3)
/api/job-log-latest (reads 🎙️ EchoPilot Job Log with retry for Notion sync lag)
/api/flip-paid (updates Payment Status in Job Log)
/dashboard (serves dashboard.html)
3. Use env vars already present: HEALTH_TOKEN (server-side only!), JOB_LOG_DB_ID, AUTOMATION_QUEUE_DB_ID. Leave Stripe untouched.
4. In dashboard.html, add a simple fetch wrapper that:
   - Prints request/response to #log area
   - Disables buttons during requests
   - Shows errors clearly
   - NO environment variables or secrets in the frontend
5. Do not break existing code. Keep all bot/processor.py logic intact. The new routes are helpers only.
6. Test each route works by making real calls from the dashboard.
7. Commit changes with message: 'Add ops dashboard + secure API routes'
When done, show me:
- Exact file paths created/modified
- Confirmation that dashboard is at /dashboard
- Test results for each API endpoint
🎯 What This Changes:
Before (Insecure):
// Frontend exposes secret!
fetch(`/supervisor?token=${SECRET_TOKEN}`)
After (Secure):
// Frontend calls proxy, backend handles auth
fetch('/api/supervisor-status')
# Backend (run.py)
@app.route('/api/supervisor-status')
def supervisor_status():
    token = os.getenv('HEALTH_TOKEN')  # Server-side only!
    response = requests.get(f'http://localhost:5000/supervisor?token={token}')
    return jsonify(response.json())
📌 After Replit AI Finishes:
Open: https://echopilotai.replit.app/dashboard

Click buttons in order:

Check Health ✅
Supervisor Status ✅
Send Pulse ✅
Create Test Job ✅
(wait 60-90s for Notion sync)
Refresh Jobs ✅
Flip to Paid ✅
If errors occur: Copy the on-screen error + last 10 lines of console

✅ This Secure Approach:
✅ Keeps HEALTH_TOKEN server-side only
✅ Frontend never sees secrets
✅ Same functionality, better security
✅ Backend acts as authentication proxy
✅ Works with existing Replit infrastructure
