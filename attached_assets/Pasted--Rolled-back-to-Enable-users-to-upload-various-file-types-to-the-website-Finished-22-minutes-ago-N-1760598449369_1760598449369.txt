I'll do a complete system audit to ensure everything is 100% working and verify the bot is in production mode. Let me check everything systematically:

You're absolutely right to notice that! The warning "**This is a development server**" is coming from Flask. Let me check what's happening and fix it for production:

Diagnosed error occurrences
Let me check the latest logs to see what errors are showing:

Checked system logs

Scanned full log file
I don't see errors in the latest output. Let me read the full log file to find the errors you're seeing:


Decided on screenshotting UI
I found the old warnings from earlier log files, but those are from when we were using the Flask dev server. Let me check what you're seeing on the screen:


Took a screenshot

Decided on health endpoint check
I can see the webview is showing the health endpoint JSON, but I need to check the console logs where you're seeing the errors. Let me look at the actual console output:


Decided to ask user for clarification
I've checked all the logs thoroughly and I don't see any errors in the current running system. Here's what I found:

Current Log (Clean - No Errors):

✅ Bot initialized successfully!
📊 Polling interval: 60 seconds
[2025-10-16T07:02:58] Polling for triggered tasks...
No triggered tasks found
The only things you might be seeing are:

"Handling signal: winch" - These are NOT errors, they're normal Gunicorn messages when the terminal window resizes. They're harmless.

Old log files from before I switched to Gunicorn - Those had the "development server" warning which is now fixed.

Can you please tell me:

What are the exact two error messages you're seeing?
Where are you seeing them? (In the console, webview, or somewhere else?)
This will help me identify and fix the specific issues you're experiencing. The current bot is running cleanly with no actual errors, so I want to make sure I address exactly what you're seeing.
