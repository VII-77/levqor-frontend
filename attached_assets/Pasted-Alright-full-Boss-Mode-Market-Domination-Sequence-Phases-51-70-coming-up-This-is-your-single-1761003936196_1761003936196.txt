🧠 COMMAND EXECUTION PLAN — PHASES 51 TO 70

🎯 Objective

Move EchoPilot from autonomous prototype → world-class AI automation product that rivals Zapier & UiPath in UX, trust, and adoption.


---

⚙️ PHASE 51–55 — Connector Framework Expansion

Goal: Match Zapier’s integration depth.

Implement:

# Create connector scripts
scripts/connectors/slack_connector.py
scripts/connectors/gmail_connector.py
scripts/connectors/drive_connector.py
scripts/connectors/trello_connector.py
scripts/connectors/calendar_connector.py

Each connector:

OAuth or API key auth

send_message(), get_data(), create_task()

Error-safe logging → logs/connectors/


Scheduler:
Add “Connector Sync” every 15 min.

Why: You can’t compete without integrations.
Impact if ignored: No users → no revenue.


---

🧩 PHASE 56–58 — Visual Builder UI

Goal: Replace command interface with drag-and-drop workflow canvas.

Steps:

1. Create /builder.html (front-end React/Tailwind).


2. Use @replit/database or Notion API for storing blocks.


3. Each block = connector + AI action + trigger.


4. Add “Run”, “Save as Template”, “Share Link”.



Why: People buy what’s visual, not code.
Impact: Raises usability + perceived polish + retention.


---

📈 PHASE 59 — Monitoring + SLA Dashboard

Goal: Enterprise-grade uptime and reliability metrics.

Build:
scripts/uptime_monitor.py

Ping scheduler + API endpoints.

Record latency and success rate to logs/uptime.ndjson.

Alert Telegram if downtime > 1 min.

Serve at /api/health/status.


Why: Trust is built on uptime.
Impact: Measurable SLA → corporate adoption.


---

🧰 PHASE 60 — Branding + Public Landing Page

Goal: Professional front door for customers.

Build:

public/index.html (landing)

public/assets/logo.svg, style.css (branded purple gradient)

Sections: Hero, How it works, Pricing, Testimonials, Dashboard Login.


Why: No face = no brand.
Impact: User trust + investor credibility.


---

💵 PHASE 61–63 — Pricing + Onboarding

Goal: Turn live payments into recurring subscriptions.

Add to run.py:

/api/plan/create → Stripe Billing Portal.

/api/plan/status → check subscription tier.

Free (10 runs/day) | Pro ($29/mo) | Enterprise (custom).


Why: Revenue flywheel.
Impact: Sustainable growth + cash flow.


---

🤖 PHASE 64–65 — Feedback AI + Support Bot

Goal: Customer support + QA feedback loop.

Scripts:

scripts/feedback_ai.py — summarize user issues via GPT-4o-mini.

/api/support/chat endpoint.

Integrate Telegram + email notifications.


Why: Customers stay when supported.
Impact: Cuts churn by > 30 %.


---

🏪 PHASE 66–70 — Community Marketplace + Scaling

Goal: Create a self-growing ecosystem.

Implement:

1. /api/templates/upload, /api/templates/list (community flows).


2. “Marketplace” tab in dashboard.


3. Governance rules + moderation via AI Ops Brain.


4. Add usage analytics + popularity sorting.



Why: Users build value for you.
Impact: Network effect + exponential adoption.
