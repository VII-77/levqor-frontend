COMMAND EXECUTION PLAN — PHASE-3: PUBLIC SCALE ROLLOUT

Objective:
Transform Levqor from stable v2.0 build into a fully public, monetized SaaS with self-sustaining growth, automated onboarding, and minimal operator load.


---

1. Infrastructure Expansion

Actions

# 1. Enable PostgreSQL as persistent store
python3 db/migrate_v2.py --apply --verify

# 2. Provision Redis queue (optional fallback)
python3 scripts/setup_queue.py --mode async

# 3. Schedule daily database backup
echo "0 3 * * * python3 db/backup.py >> logs/backup.log 2>&1" >> /etc/crontab

Why

Moves from SQLite to scalable persistence.

Enables concurrent workflow processing.

Daily snapshots prevent data loss.
Impact if ignored: risk of corruption under concurrent use.



---

2. Monitoring & Stability

Actions

# 4. Install and activate Sentry
export SENTRY_DSN=<your_dsn>
python3 scripts/sentry_test.py

# 5. Expose /metrics to Prometheus or Grafana
curl -fsS http://localhost:5000/metrics | head

Why

Error visibility and latency tracking.

Live dashboards for uptime verification.
Impact if ignored: silent production failures.



---

3. User Growth Automation

Actions

# 6. Launch referral credit system
python3 scripts/referral_init.py --credits 20

# 7. Activate free-trial funnel
python3 scripts/trial_campaign.py --duration 7

# 8. Enable auto-email onboarding
python3 bot/mailer.py --mode welcome

Why

Creates viral growth via referral incentives.

Converts signups to paid users automatically.

Sends onboarding tips and usage summaries.
Impact if ignored: low activation and conversion.



---

4. Business Operations

Actions

# 9. Enable automated invoices and failed-payment handlers
python3 billing/webhook_tester.py --check all

# 10. Configure support & billing inboxes
export SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@levqor.ai
export BILLING_EMAIL=billing@levqor.ai

Why

Self-service customer management.

Reduces manual workload to zero.
Impact if ignored: churn risk and unhandled refunds.



---

5. Marketing & SEO

Actions

# 11. Push updated SEO sitemap and robots.txt
python3 scripts/seo_refresh.py

# 12. Verify analytics tracking
python3 scripts/analytics_check.py --plausible --heap

Why

Improves discoverability and referral tracking.

Supports measurable marketing performance.
Impact if ignored: stagnated traffic growth.



---

6. Documentation & Legal

Actions

# 13. Publish updated legal documents
python3 scripts/legal_sync.py

# 14. Generate public API docs
python3 scripts/docs_build.py --publish

Why

Legal compliance and transparency.

Developer readiness for API integrations.
Impact if ignored: compliance gaps and lost credibility.



---

7. Verification Suite

Actions

bash verify_production.sh
python3 scripts/canary_check.sh

Why

Ensures nothing regressed during rollout.
Impact if ignored: undetected failure post-launch.
