🚀 RFP-2 — AUTOMATED SALES ENGINE (ASE)

Paste into Replit AI Agent exactly as is.

You are Replit AI Agent for Levqor.

GOAL: Build Levqor’s automated sales engine:
– Auto-reply sequences
– Lead nurturing
– DFY consult funnel
– High-conversion triggers
– Admin dashboards
– Critical alerts

=======================================
PHASE 1 — EMAIL TEMPLATES (SERVER)
=======================================
Create folder: src/emails/sales/
Add templates:

1) lead_received()
Subject: “We got your request — here’s what happens next”
Body: timeline (24–48h), reassurance, CTA → /pricing

2) dfy_interest()
Subject: “DFY Automation — Let’s start your build”
Body: checklist, kickoff link → /dfy-kickoff

3) hot_lead()
Subject: “Quick question before I build your workflow…”
Body: 3 qualification questions:
- What’s your biggest bottleneck?
- How fast do you need this done?
- Do you want DFY or subscription?

4) abandoned_checkout()
Triggered if user starts checkout but does not pay in 10 min
Subject: “Still want to automate your business?”
Body: 1–click resume checkout link

=======================================
PHASE 2 — SALES ENGINE ROUTES
=======================================
Add API routes:

1) POST /api/sales/lead-nurture  
Input: lead_id  
Logic:
- send lead_received()
- wait 2h
- send hot_lead()

2) POST /api/sales/dfy-followup  
Input: kickoff_id  
Logic:
- send dfy_interest()
- wait 4h
- send hot_lead()

3) POST /api/sales/recover-checkout  
Input: session_id  
Logic:
- send abandoned_checkout()

=======================================
PHASE 3 — AUTOMATED TRIGGERS
=======================================
Trigger sequences:

1) When new lead is created → POST /api/sales/lead-nurture  

2) When DFY kickoff submitted → POST /api/sales/dfy-followup  

3) When Stripe webhook “checkout.session.expired” → POST /api/sales/recover-checkout  

Ensure logs saved in audit table.

=======================================
PHASE 4 — SALES DASHBOARD
=======================================
Add admin route: /admin/sales-dashboard  
Protected via admin email.

Sections:
- New leads (last 30 days)
- DFY kickoffs
- Lost leads (no reply in 48h)
- Hot leads (answered questionnaire)
- DFY pipeline (Starter/Pro/Enterprise)
- Revenue summary (Stripe API)
- Traffic → lead → checkout → conversion funnel

=======================================
PHASE 5 — HIGH-CONVERSION WIDGETS
=======================================

1) Sticky bottom-bar CTA on all pages:
“Need help? Talk to us — free 5-minute audit”
Button → opens modal

2) Exit-intent popup (desktop):
Headline: “Want your first workflow automated FREE?”
CTA → collect email → send lead_received() template

3) Pricing Page Enhancer:
Add micro copy:
– “Secure Stripe Checkout”
– “Instant access”
– “Cancel anytime”
– “Cheaper than hiring a VA”

=======================================
PHASE 6 — FINAL CHECKS
=======================================
Validate:
- All email templates compile
- Triggers fire correctly
- Dashboard loads without errors
- Funnel logic accurate
- No logs missing
- Stripe webhooks firing

Output: “RFP-2 COMPLETE”
Stop.
