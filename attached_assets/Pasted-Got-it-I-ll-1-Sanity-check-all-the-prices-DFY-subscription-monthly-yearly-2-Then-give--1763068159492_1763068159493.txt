Got it. I’ll:

1. Sanity-check all the prices (DFY + subscription, monthly + yearly)


2. Then give you one final Replit AI Agent prompt that bakes all of this in and tells the agent to double-check everything.




---

1) How the prices actually hang together

A. Done-For-You (DFY – one-time)

We currently have:

Tier	Price	Workflows	Delivery	Support	Approx £ per workflow

Starter	£99	1	48 hours	7 days	£99 / workflow
Professional	£249	3	3–4 days	30 days + monitoring	~£83 / workflow
Enterprise	£599	7	7 days	30 days + dashboard	~£85 / workflow


Why this makes sense:

Starter is “test us cheaply”: £99 for 1 workflow.

Professional gives a genuine volume discount: 3 workflows for £249 → you’re effectively charging less per workflow if they commit more money (good for them, good for you).

Enterprise is the “serious buyer” tier. 7 workflows for £599 is still reasonable per workflow, but the real value here is:

More moving parts to maintain

Monitoring + dashboard

Higher perceived value



So DFY is internally consistent:

No stupid underpricing like 7 workflows for less than 3.

Discounts roughly scale with commitment.


If you want pure maths:

Starter: £99/workflow

Professional: ~£83/workflow

Enterprise: ~£85/workflow (but with stronger add-ons)


I’m keeping these exactly as they are – they’re defensible, simple to understand, and they make you money without being ridiculous.

B. Subscriptions (recurring)

We now have 4 subscription tiers:

Tier	Monthly	Yearly	“Months charged” (yearly ÷ monthly)	Positioning

Starter	£29/mo	£290/yr	10 months → 2 months free	Solo / very small teams
Growth	£79/mo	£790/yr	10 months → 2 months free	Small teams scaling
Pro	£149/mo	£1,490/yr	10 months → 2 months free	Serious operations, multiple flows
Business	£299/mo	£2,990/yr	10 months → 2 months free	“We run your ops” level


So yearly = 10 × monthly for all tiers.

That gives you a clear, standard SaaS line:
“Pay yearly and get 2 months free.”

These numbers are:

Not “cheap toy” pricing (so people take you seriously).

Not insanely high compared to typical automation / ops tools.

Laddered so that:

Starter is entry,

Growth is for “we’re using this seriously now”,

Pro & Business are for teams that rely on Levqor as core infra.



DFY vs Subscription relationship:

A Pro DFY project at £249 is a one-time build.

A Growth or Pro subscription at £79/£149 per month is an ongoing relationship:

Monitoring

Iterations

Additional workflows over time



That balance works:

You’re not giving away DFY for pennies.

Monthly tiers are high enough to matter, but not insane for businesses.


I’m keeping these exact prices and standardizing messaging to:

DFY = one-time build

Subscription = ongoing platform + support with 2 months free yearly.

2) Final Replit AI Agent Prompt (covers EVERYTHING, including price checks)

Copy–paste this as-is into Replit AI Agent:

You are Levqor’s Lead Engineer + Product Ops. Your mission: **verify and finalize Levqor’s dual pricing system (DFY + Subscription)** so the app is truly “ready to take money” with the correct prices, correct text, and correct Stripe mappings – without breaking anything.

You have full access to this Replit workspace. Follow ALL steps carefully, and DO NOT skip verification.

====================================
PHASE 0 – PROJECT + GOAL
====================================

Goal:
- Levqor must have:
  - A working **dual pricing model**:
    - DFY (one-time, Stripe `mode: "payment"`)
    - Subscription (monthly/yearly, Stripe `mode: "subscription"`)
  - Prices in code and on UI matching EXACTLY what we want.
  - Stripe env var mappings clean and correct.
  - `/pricing`, `/success`, `/cancel`, `/api/checkout` all working and consistent.

Target prices (these are FINAL, do NOT change them):

1) DFY (DONE-FOR-YOU, ONE-TIME)
- Starter:      £99       – 1 workflow, 48-hour delivery, 7 days support
- Professional: £249      – 3 workflows, 3–4 days delivery, 30 days support + monitoring
- Enterprise:   £599      – 7 workflows, 7 days delivery, 30 days support + dashboard

2) SUBSCRIPTIONS (RECURRING)
- Starter:   £29/mo   or £290/yr  (2 months free)
- Growth:    £79/mo   or £790/yr  (2 months free)
- Pro:       £149/mo  or £1,490/yr (2 months free)
- Business:  £299/mo  or £2,990/yr (2 months free)

If you find ANYTHING different in the code or UI, FIX IT to match the above table.

====================================
PHASE 1 – DISCOVER PRICING + CHECKOUT CODE
====================================

1. Go to the frontend project:
   - `cd ~/workspace/levqor-site`

2. Open and INSPECT these files:
   - `src/config/pricing.ts`
   - `src/app/pricing/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts`
   - `src/app/success/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/cancel/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/signin/page.tsx`

3. For each of these, answer for yourself (and later in a comment at the bottom of pricing.ts):

   - Do DFY prices in code match:
     - Starter £99
     - Professional £249
     - Enterprise £599

   - Do subscription prices in code match:
     - Starter £29 & £290
     - Growth £79 & £790
     - Pro £149 & £1,490
     - Business £299 & £2,990

   - Are the following **plan keys** used consistently everywhere:
     - DFY plans: `"starter" | "professional" | "enterprise"`
     - Subscription plans: `"starter" | "growth" | "pro" | "business"`

   - Does `/api/checkout`:
     - Accept `mode: "dfy" | "subscription"`?
     - Use `mode: "payment"` for DFY and `mode: "subscription"` for subs?
     - Map each plan to the correct env var?

4. If any mismatches exist (prices, plan names, mode, or env var keys):
   - FIX the code.
   - Keep logic simple and explicit.
   - DO NOT introduce new plan names or weird mapping.

====================================
PHASE 2 – ENV VAR MAPPING + SANITY
====================================

1. In the backend or config, locate env var usage for Stripe price IDs.
   - You SHOULD see something like:
     - Subscription:
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER`
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER_YEAR`
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH`
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH_YEAR`
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO`
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_YEAR`
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS`
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS_YEAR`
     - DFY:
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_DFY_STARTER`
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_DFY_PROFESSIONAL`
       - `STRIPE_PRICE_DFY_ENTERPRISE`

2. In `src/config/pricing.ts`:
   - Make sure each plan has an explicit mapping to ONE env var for each billing model:
     - DFY plan → ONE DFY env var.
     - Subscription plan & term → ONE subscription env var.

3. At the **BOTTOM** of `src/config/pricing.ts`, add a clear comment block that prints a console-friendly summary, for example:

   ```ts
   // DEBUG PRICING SUMMARY (keep this comment up to date):
   // DFY:
   //  - Starter:      £99       (env: STRIPE_PRICE_DFY_STARTER)
   //  - Professional: £249      (env: STRIPE_PRICE_DFY_PROFESSIONAL)
   //  - Enterprise:   £599      (env: STRIPE_PRICE_DFY_ENTERPRISE)
   //
   // Subscription (monthly / yearly, 2 months free):
   //  - Starter:   £29/mo   | £290/yr  (env: STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER / STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER_YEAR)
   //  - Growth:    £79/mo   | £790/yr  (env: STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH / STRIPE_PRICE_GROWTH_YEAR)
   //  - Pro:       £149/mo  | £1,490/yr (env: STRIPE_PRICE_PRO / STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_YEAR)
   //  - Business:  £299/mo  | £2,990/yr (env: STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS / STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS_YEAR)

4. DO NOT hard-code actual Stripe IDs; just ensure the code EXPECTS the env vars with those names.



==================================== PHASE 3 – PRICING PAGE UI CONSISTENCY

Your job now is to make sure the /pricing page:

1. Displays EXACTLY these numbers in the UI:

DFY section:

£99

£249

£599


Subscription section:

Monthly: £29 / £79 / £149 / £299

Yearly:  £290 / £790 / £1,490 / £2,990

Clearly show “2 months free” or equivalent text for yearly.




2. Shows sensible feature/perk differences that match the price:

DFY higher tiers should clearly show:

More workflows

Faster or reasonable delivery windows

Longer support / monitoring


Subscription higher tiers should show:

More workflows

Better response times

More support / optimization / “managed” feel




3. All “Get started” / “Buy” buttons on /pricing:

Call the checkout function, NOT just link to /signin.

For DFY buttons → call checkout with { mode: "dfy", plan: "<plan>" }.

For subscription buttons → call checkout with { mode: "subscription", plan: "<plan>", term: "<monthly|yearly>" }.



4. Add or keep a clear copy line somewhere like:

For DFY section: “One-time build – fixed price, no subscription.”

For subscription section: “Ongoing platform + support – billed monthly or yearly (2 months free on yearly).”




==================================== PHASE 4 – CHECKOUT API BEHAVIOUR

In src/app/api/checkout/route.ts:

1. Verify:

It reads the request JSON with mode, plan, and optional term.

It branches correctly:

if mode === "dfy" → use Stripe Checkout with mode: "payment".

if mode === "subscription" → use Stripe Checkout with mode: "subscription".




2. Verify for every plan name:

"starter", "professional", "enterprise" → DFY env vars.

"starter", "growth", "pro", "business" → Subscription env vars.



3. Make sure error messages are:

Clear for missing env vars (e.g. “DFY Starter price not configured – contact support.”)

Not leaking secrets.



4. Add a simple safe GET handler (if not already present) that:

Returns JSON like:

Which modes are available.

Which env vars appear missing.


Does NOT reveal values, only which are set vs missing.




==================================== PHASE 5 – SUCCESS + CANCEL PAGES

1. src/app/success/page.tsx:

Ensure it handles both flows:

DFY: shows copy like “We’ll start building your workflows; expect delivery within X days”.

Subscription: shows copy like “Your subscription is active; you’ll get access + onboarding”.


If there’s a type query param (dfy vs subscription), honour it.

CTA buttons:

“Back to homepage”

“Sign in to your dashboard”




2. src/app/cancel/page.tsx:

Confirm message says clearly: payment not processed, you have NOT been charged.

Provide links:

Back to pricing

Contact support





==================================== PHASE 6 – LOCAL VERIFICATION

1. Run a production-style build:

cd ~/workspace/levqor-site

npm run build

If build fails, FIX the errors. Do not ignore them.



2. Start dev server (if needed) or rely on the existing workflow.


3. VERIFY, using actual HTTP requests (not assumptions):

curl -sI http://localhost:5000/pricing | head -5

Expect 200 OK.


curl -s http://localhost:5000/pricing | grep -E "£99|£249|£599|£29|£79|£149|£299" | head -20

Confirm all prices appear in the HTML.


Optionally test POST body shape (no real Stripe call if keys missing – just ensure the route behaves correctly and returns structured JSON).



4. DO NOT touch live secrets. Only confirm the code is correct and ready.



==================================== PHASE 7 – FINAL DEV NOTE FOR THE USER

At the end, in a new comment in src/config/pricing.ts, add a short note like:

// DEV NOTE (Replit Agent):
// - Pricing verified on <DATE>.
// - DFY: 99 / 249 / 599 one-time aligned with 1 / 3 / 7 workflows.
// - Subscription: 29 / 79 / 149 / 299 monthly with 2 months free yearly.
// - All plan keys and env var names consistent across pricing.ts, /pricing, and /api/checkout.
// - Ready for Stripe IDs to be configured in Vercel/Replit env vars.

Make NO other “creative” changes beyond what’s needed to:

Match the exact price table above

Keep plan names consistent

Ensure checkout and pages work.


That prompt tells the agent to **audit all prices, all mappings, and all routes at the same time**, and to keep everything aligned with the exact DFY + subscription numbers we agreed.
