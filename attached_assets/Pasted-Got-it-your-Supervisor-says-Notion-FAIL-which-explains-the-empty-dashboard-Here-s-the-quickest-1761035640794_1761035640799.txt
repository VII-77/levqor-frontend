Got it — your Supervisor says Notion = FAIL, which explains the empty dashboard. Here’s the quickest path to green.

Fix-now plan (5 tight steps)

1. Restart both workers



Replit → Workflows → stop/start EchoPilot Bot and Scheduler.


2. Verify Notion secrets are loaded



In Secrets, confirm these exist (not blank):
NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID, NOTION_CLIENT_DB_ID, JOB_LOG_DB_ID, NOTION_STATUS_DB_ID, NOTION_PRICING_DB_ID, NOTION_REFERRALS_DB_ID, NOTION_GROWTH_METRICS_DB_ID, NOTION_FINANCE_DB_ID, NOTION_GOVERNANCE_DB_ID, NOTION_OPS_MONITOR_DB_ID, NOTION_FORECAST_DB_ID, NOTION_REGION_COMPLIANCE_DB_ID, NOTION_COST_DB_ID, NOTION_COST_DASHBOARD_DB_ID.


3. Re-grant the Notion integration (most common cause)



In Notion, open the Job Log database → ••• (menu) → Connections → Connect the EchoPilot integration.

Repeat for Status, Pricing, and any DBs the dashboard reads. (If the token was rotated, all DBs need to be reconnected once.)


4. Run these two checks and paste results if anything is red



Status summary:

curl -s -H "X-Dash-Key: YOUR_DASHBOARD_KEY" \
https://echopilotai.replit.app/api/status/summary | jq .

Scheduler state:

curl -s -H "X-Dash-Key: YOUR_DASHBOARD_KEY" \
https://echopilotai.replit.app/api/automations/status | jq .


5. Confirm data is flowing



Open /dashboard/v2 → hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R).

If still empty, open https://echopilotai.replit.app/logs/scheduler.log and copy the last ~50 lines that mention notion (401/403/429 errors indicate auth/permission/rate-limit).


One copy-paste prompt (for your notes / team)

“Run EchoPilot daily health:

1. Open /health and share the JSON.


2. Open /supervisor?token=… and share the first 3 lines.


3. In Notion Job Log, confirm a new row in the last 5 minutes and the latest job’s QA score.


4. If anything fails, share the exact error on screen plus the last 10 lines from the Replit console.”

If you send me: (a) the two curl JSONs, and (b) any Notion error lines from scheduler.log, I’ll pinpoint whether it’s missing connection, bad DB ID, or rate limiting, and give the exact fix.
