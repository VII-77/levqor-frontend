🧠 BOSS MODE: “EchoPilot — Win the Market” (One-Prompt Buildout)

Mission: Make EchoPilot the most user-friendly, reliable, and enterprise-ready AI ops platform—clearly better than any competitor—without breaking what’s live. Ship a polished UX, airtight security, bulletproof reliability, clear docs, and growth levers. Optimize for mobile first, speed, and zero-friction onboarding. Keep Stripe LIVE intact.


---

0) Guardrails & Principles

No downtime. Use feature flags + canary routes.

Mobile first. 360–430px layouts are the source of truth.

Fast. TTI ≤ 1.5s on 4G; Lighthouse (Mobile) ≥ 95/100/100/100.

Accessible. WCAG 2.2 AA, keyboard-first, prefers-reduced-motion.

Observable. Every user action, API call, and scheduler tick emits structured events.

Secure by default. Principle of least privilege, secrets never leak, audit everything.

Reversible. Every change has a rollback plan and migration notes.



---

1) UX & IA (Information Architecture) — “Delight by default”

Do:

Replace dashboard.html with a mobile-first shell: sticky header (logo, live status pill), bottom tab bar on mobile (Automations, Payments, Ops, Audit, Settings), left rail appears ≥1024px.

Fix auth key bar: input, “Save Key”, “Clear”, and a real Submit button; persist state; show key validity with a green/red pill.

Add empty states + skeletons for CEO Briefs, Alerts, Payments, and Audit (each guides to next action).

Toasts for success/error; non-blocking spinners during API calls; optimistic UI where safe.

Add /landing (hero, 3 benefits, live status ping, CTA → “Open Dashboard”) and /about (commit, uptime, versions).

Command Palette (⌘K/CTRL+K): search actions, routes, and logs; runs with keyboard only.

Dark mode toggle with localStorage.theme; respect system preference.


Acceptance:

Mobile nav is thumb-reachable, no horizontal scroll; all flows complete on a phone.

Lighthouse (Mobile): Perf ≥95, A11y ≥100, BP ≥100, SEO ≥100.



---

2) Speed & Reliability — “Feels instant”

Do:

Add HTTP caching for read-only routes; ETag/Cache-Control for /api/status/summary.

Introduce in-memory LRU cache (15–60s) for high-churn status endpoints.

CDN/edge safe headers for static assets.

Queue long operations (reports/self-heal) with background job pattern; UI polls /api/jobs/:id.

Add feature flags (JSON file/env) for all new UI cards.


Acceptance:

P95 API latency < 300ms for status endpoints.

No blocking calls on the request thread; job polling works with graceful errors.



---

3) Security & Compliance — “Enterprise-grade”

Do:

Require X-Dash-Key everywhere admin; add rate-limit (Key+IP) with exponential backoff & lockout.

CSRF for POST forms; CSP: default-src ‘self’; no inline scripts; nonce pipeline if needed.

Secrets hygiene: never render secrets to frontend logs; redact in NDJSON.

Audit NDJSON: every sensitive action emits {ts,user,action,target,ok,latency} into logs/audit.ndjson.

PII boundary: tag fields; only included in exports behind double-confirm modal.

Stripe (LIVE): webhook idempotency, signature verify, refund/dispute events handled and logged.


Acceptance:

ZAP/Burp passive scan clean; headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, COOP/COEP set.

Test negative paths: invalid keys, brute attempts, replayed webhooks → safely rejected & logged.



---

4) Observability & Ops — “Know before it breaks”

Do:

Standardize structured logs: logs/ui_events.ndjson, logs/api.ndjson, logs/scheduler.ndjson, logs/payments.ndjson.

Add /api/status/summary aggregating: scheduler.running, next jobs, Stripe webhook last 10, error budget.

SLOs: uptime target 99.9%; compute error budget and expose to dashboard.

Alerting (keep your existing script, add):

Webhook failures > 3 in 5m (Critical)

Payment error rate > 5%/h (Critical)

Revenue −30% DoD (Warn)

Scheduler no tick > 90s (Critical)



Acceptance:

Status card shows clear green/amber/red with cause; alerts produce real entries in logs.



---

5) Payments & Pricing — “Frictionless & fair”

Do:

Payments center card: Create invoice, List last 10, Refund (admin-only), links to Stripe receipt.

Guardrails: min $0.50, round to 2dp, reject negatives/NaN; idempotency keys by email+ts.

Auto-email receipts (Stripe), optional tax; safe webhooks for success, refund, dispute.


Acceptance:

Live $0.50 charge+refund flows work; webhook events visible in UI within 5s.



---

6) AI Quality & Safety — “Smart + safe”

Do:

Centralize prompts in /prompts/*.md; add version tags and A/B variants for CEO Brief & Ops Brain.

Add evaluation harness: replay last N briefs with synthetic fixtures; store scores in logs/ai_eval.ndjson.

Guardrails: refuse sensitive actions; log model/version, tokens, latency; redact PII in eval logs.


Acceptance:

Switch prompts without redeploy (flag); eval report JSON rendered in Audit tab.



---

7) Internationalization & Accessibility — “Welcome everyone”

Do:

I18n scaffold (JSON) for labels; detect locale; default en-US with graceful fallback.

Keyboard reachability tests; visible focus rings; semantic landmarks; aria-labels on buttons.


Acceptance:

Switch to ar, fr stubs without layout break; axe-core passes.



---

8) Docs & Onboarding — “5-minute wow”

Do:

/docs/GET_STARTED.md (mobile-first): 90-sec quickstart, Stripe live switch, key workflows.

/docs/RUNBOOK.md update for Workflows + rollbacks; /docs/SECURITY.md for buyers.

Add guided tips (coach-marks) for first-time users (dismiss + “Don’t show again”).


Acceptance:

A first-time user can create a test brief + see status in < 5 minutes without help.



---

9) Growth Loops — “Compounding by design”

Do:

Referral code in Settings (copy button), share URL; attribute events to code.

Add feedback widget (NPS 0–10) post-action; logs to logs/nps.ndjson.

Add changelog badge in header; links to /docs/CHANGELOG.md.


Acceptance:

Referral link creates attributed session; NPS stored and visible in Governance card.



---

10) Rollout Plan & QA

Ship behind flags; enable to 10% internal.

Canary monitoring: if error rate > 2% or P95 > 600ms for 5m → auto-disable flags + log incident.

Create /logs/GO_LIVE_UI_v2.txt with: lighthouse scores, perf budgets, checklists, and toggled flags.



---

Concrete Changes (edit/create)

dashboard.html (new shell, tabs, status pill, toasts, modals, command palette).

templates/landing.html, templates/about.html.

static/app.css (tokens: colors/spacing; components: .btn, .card, .pill, .toast, .skeleton).

run.py add: /landing, /about, /api/status/summary, /api/jobs/:id, rate-limit middleware, stricter headers.

scripts/feature_flags.json (keys for UI cards).

Logs: logs/ui_events.ndjson, logs/api.ndjson, logs/audit.ndjson, logs/ai_eval.ndjson.

Docs: /docs/GET_STARTED.md, /docs/SECURITY.md, update /RUNBOOK.md, /CHANGELOG.md.

Prompts: /prompts/ceo_brief_v{n}.md, /prompts/ops_brain_v{n}.md; eval harness script.



---

Tests & Acceptance (must pass)

Mobile flows: auth → run brief → see status → create invoice → refund → audit.

Negative tests: invalid key, webhook replay, large payload, offline Stripe → graceful errors.

Security headers present; rate-limit proves functional; audit entries appear for sensitive actions.

Lighthouse mobile ≥ 95/100/100/100; CLS ≤ 0.05; P95 endpoint < 300ms.



---

Commit & Flags

Commit: feat(ui-v2): mobile-first shell, status summary, flags, toasts, security headers, obs; docs & prompts

Default flags off, then enable ui_v2_shell, payments_center, status_summary, coach_marks progressively.



---

Rollback

Toggle flags off → revert to prior UI instantly.

Keep legacy routes intact; no schema changes without migrations + backups.



---

Deliver this end-to-end now while preserving current LIVE operations (Stripe, scheduler, webhooks). When done, write logs/GO_LIVE_UI_v2.txt with scores, flags, and any deltas.
