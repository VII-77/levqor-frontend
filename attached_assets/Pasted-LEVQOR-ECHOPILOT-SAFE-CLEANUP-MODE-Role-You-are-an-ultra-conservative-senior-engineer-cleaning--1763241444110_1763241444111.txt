LEVQOR / ECHOPILOT – SAFE CLEANUP MODE
Role: You are an ultra-conservative senior engineer cleaning up a production-ready system (Levqor + EchoPilot). The system is ALREADY LIVE. Your job is to reduce clutter, NOT to break anything. You must assume I am non-technical and cannot fix deep damage. When in doubt, KEEP the file.

GOALS
1. Reduce noise: move or remove obvious junk (duplicated reports, obsolete drafts, temporary logs).
2. Keep ALL production code, configs, migrations, and deployment scripts fully intact.
3. Make the repo easier to navigate, without affecting running services, tests, or deployments.

ABSOLUTE SAFETY RULES (DO NOT BREAK THESE)
1. DO NOT delete or modify:
   - Any file under: `backend/`, `server/`, `src/`, `modules/`, `monitors/`, `migrations/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `public/`, `revenue-engine/`, `retention/`, `billing/`, `dunning/`, `api/`.
   - Any `*.py`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.json`, `*.sql`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `vercel.*`, `replit.*`, `package*.json`, `requirements*.txt`, `.env*` (if present), or any config in `.github/`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`.
   - Any database files (`*.db`), migrations, or schema files.
   - Any scripts used for deployment, health checks, Stripe, support chat, schedulers, or monitoring (e.g. `deploy*.sh`, `verify*.sh`, `fix-and-deploy.sh`, `finalize-deployment.sh`, `echopilot-final-healthcheck.sh`, etc.).

2. NO GIT HISTORY DAMAGE:
   - Do NOT run `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fdx`, or any rewrite of history.
   - Only use `git add/commit` to record SAFE changes.

3. NO AUTOMATED MASS DELETE:
   - Do NOT `rm` whole directories.
   - For any file that might be important, MOVE it to an archive folder instead of deleting.

4. MANDATORY VERIFICATION:
   - Before and after changes, run:
     - `git status`
     - Backend sanity: `python run.py` (or the existing start command) and confirm the app boots and `/health` still returns HTTP 200 locally.
   - If ANY error appears, immediately revert the last change and stop.

CLEANUP STRATEGY
You are working in `/workspace/Levqor-backend` and (if present) `/workspace/levqor-site`.

STEP 1 – INVENTORY (READ-ONLY)
1. From the repo root (`/workspace/Levqor-backend`), generate a size + type inventory:
   - `find . -maxdepth 4 -type f -printf "%p\t%k KB\n" | sort -k2 -nr | head -200`
   - Identify:
     - Very large `.md` or `.log` files.
     - Obvious, clearly redundant report files (e.g. many overlapping status / summary reports).
2. Produce a short MARKDOWN report `CLEANUP-CANDIDATES.md` containing:
   - A table with columns: `path`, `size_kb`, `reason_candidate`.
   - Only include files that are safe candidates (primarily docs/logs/reports), NOT code.

STEP 2 – DEFINE SAFE ARCHIVE
1. Create an archive folder:
   - `/workspace/Levqor-backend/archive/2025-11-15-legacy-docs/`
2. Only the following types of files are allowed to be moved into the archive:
   - Markdown reports and docs that are clearly diagnostic / historical:
     - Files matching patterns like:
       - `*REPORT*.md`
       - `*SUMMARY*.md`
       - `*STATUS*.md`
       - `*CHECKLIST*.md`
       - `*RUNBOOK*.md`
       - `*DIAGNOSTICS*.md`
       - `*NUCLEAR*.md`
       - `*VERIFICATION*.md`
       - `*IMPLEMENTATION*.md`
       - `DAY-*-*.md`
       - Old phase docs like `PHASE_*_SUMMARY.md`
   - Raw logs: `*.log` under `integrity_reports/` or similar.
3. Do NOT move:
   - `README*`, `HOW_TO_DEPLOY.md`, any file explicitly labeled “QUICK START”, “BEGINNER GUIDE”, or “FINAL” related to live system operation (e.g. `FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.txt`, `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`, `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md`).
   - Any doc referenced by other docs (for example: if `README` links to it as required).

STEP 3 – MOVE (NOT DELETE) CANDIDATES
1. For each candidate in `CLEANUP-CANDIDATES.md`:
   - Confirm it is:
     - Not imported by code.
     - Not referenced in `README*`, `HOW_TO_DEPLOY.md`, `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`, or other high-level docs (use `grep -R "<filename>" .` to check).
   - If safe, MOVE it into the archive:
     - `mkdir -p archive/2025-11-15-legacy-docs`
     - `git mv <path> archive/2025-11-15-legacy-docs/`
2. After moving, run:
   - `git status`
   - Start the backend (e.g. `python run.py`) and hit `/health` locally with `curl` to ensure it still returns HTTP 200.

STEP 4 – FRONTEND (IF `levqor-site` EXISTS)
1. If `/workspace/levqor-site` exists, apply a similar cleanup BUT EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE:
   - Only treat Markdown docs and logs as candidates.
   - Do NOT touch anything inside `src/`, `.next/` (if present), `public/`, `node_modules/`, or build config files.
2. Create:
   - `/workspace/levqor-site/archive/2025-11-15-legacy-docs/`
3. Move only obvious diagnostic / historical `.md` or `.log` files using `git mv` and update a `FRONTEND-CLEANUP-CANDIDATES.md` summary.

STEP 5 – SUMMARY & COMMIT
1. Produce a final Markdown summary at repo root:
   - `CLEANUP-SUMMARY-2025-11-15.md`
   - Include:
     - Number of files moved.
     - Total KB moved.
     - Explicit statement: “No code, configuration, migrations, scripts, or database files were deleted or modified. All changes are relocations of legacy documentation/logs.”
2. Show final `git status` output inside that summary so I can see what will be committed.
3. If everything is clean and backend `/health` passes locally:
   - Create a single commit:
     - `git add .`
     - `git commit -m "chore: archive legacy reports and logs (safe cleanup)"`
   - Do NOT push. I will push manually after reviewing.

VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW)
- At each critical step (before moves, after moves, after commit), echo commands and results into the summary files so a non-technical owner can review.
- If you are unsure about ANY file, leave it where it is and add a note to `CLEANUP-CANDIDATES.md` explaining why you skipped it.

OUTPUT BACK TO ME
When done, print:
- A short list of the top 20 moved files (paths).
- The total disk space reclaimed (approximate, in KB/MB).
- Any files you were unsure about.

Execute this plan now, EXACTLY as written, with maximum caution.
