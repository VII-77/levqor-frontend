Open my EchopilotAI Replit and do ALL of this in one pass to finalize Phase 30 with Workflow-based persistence + proof:

1) Migrate scheduler to Replit Workflow (primary path)
  - Create a workflow named "Scheduler" that runs:
      python3 scripts/exec_scheduler.py
    • It must run in the project root, foreground, restart on crash, and persist logs.
    • Confirm logs/scheduler.log receives a startup line and minute "tick" heartbeats.

2) Keep CLI controls as fallback (do not remove)
  - Retain scripts/run_automations.sh (start/stop/status) and the /api/automations/* endpoints.
  - If workflows are unavailable, those controls must still work manually.

3) Hardening checks (fix if missing)
  - scripts/exec_scheduler.py:
      • Writes PID to logs/scheduler.pid on start, removes it on clean exit.
      • SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers log {"event":"shutdown"} then exit(0).
      • Main loop: every 60s write NDJSON {"event":"tick","next":{brief,report,selfheal}} to logs/scheduler.log.
      • On startup, retention runs once (log start/done).
      • All exceptions caught and logged; loop never dies silently.
  - dashboard.html (⚙️ Automations):
      • Start/Stop/Status buttons call /api/automations/*.
      • Add "Auto-refresh status" toggle (every 10s) showing running, PID, last_activity.

4) Verification (execute and include results in your final output)
  A. Start the Scheduler via Workflow UI programmatically (if supported) or document the exact steps; ALSO start via API as fallback:
     curl -s -H "X-Dash-Key: $DASHBOARD_KEY" -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/automations/start | python3 -m json.tool
  B. Wait ~70s; then show:
     - /api/automations/status JSON
     - Last 10 lines of logs/scheduler.log (must include ≥1 "tick")
  C. Manual autonomy cycle (prove core ops still work):
     DASHBOARD_KEY=$DASHBOARD_KEY make run-brief
     DASHBOARD_KEY=$DASHBOARD_KEY make run-selfheal
     curl -s -H "X-Dash-Key: $DASHBOARD_KEY" http://localhost:5000/api/metrics-summary | python3 -m json.tool
  D. Stop + Start again to prove clean lifecycle:
     curl -s -H "X-Dash-Key: $DASHBOARD_KEY" -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/automations/stop | python3 -m json.tool
     curl -s -H "X-Dash-Key: $DASHBOARD_KEY" -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/automations/start | python3 -m json.tool

5) Deliverables (return these verbatim)
  - STATUS JSON (from /api/automations/status) showing running:true and a PID.
  - Last 10 lines of logs/scheduler.log (must include at least one {"event":"tick"} line).
  - Paths of the latest CEO brief JSON/HTML.
  - One-line summary of self-heal result.
  - Confirmation that dashboard auto-refresh shows live status updates.

6) Commit
  Commit message:
  "Phase 30 final: Workflow-based persistent scheduler + dashboard auto-refresh + API controls (start/stop/status) + heartbeat proof"
