Open my Echopilotai Replit and do ALL of this in one go (without exposing secrets in frontend):

GOAL
- Finish Phase 24: secure Ops Dashboard + daily health + metrics + one-click validation.

1) SECURITY (backend only)
- In run.py add DASHBOARD_KEY auth middleware for ALL /api/* routes (reject missing/invalid key with 401).
- Keep HEALTH_TOKEN server-side only. Never reference process.env in dashboard.html.
- Add basic security headers on every response (Cache-Control: no-store, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-Frame-Options: DENY).
- For POST routes, require X-Dashboard-Key header == DASHBOARD_KEY.

2) API ROUTES (Flask)
Add or update these JSON routes (all secured via DASHBOARD_KEY except /health):
- GET /health → {"ok": true, "data": {"status":"ok"}}
- GET /api/supervisor-status → internally call /supervisor?token=$HEALTH_TOKEN; return condensed summary.
- POST /api/pulse → internally POST /pulse?token=$HEALTH_TOKEN; return {"ok": true, "data": {"id": "..."}}
- POST /api/create-test-job → write a new row to Automation Queue using sample payload https://filesamples.com/samples/audio/mp3/sample1.mp3 with properties: Task Name (title), Description (rich_text), Trigger (checkbox=true), Status (select="New"). Handle missing properties gracefully with a helpful error.
- GET /api/job-log-latest → query 🎙️ EchoPilot Job Log with retry backoff [10,20,40,60]; return latest {qa_score, duration_sec, duration_min, gross_usd, profit_usd, margin_pct, payment_link, payment_status, page_id}.
- POST /api/flip-paid → body {page_id}; update that Job Log row Payment Status="Paid"; return confirmation.
- GET /api/metrics-summary → read Governance DB; return {jobs_7d, revenue_7d, avg_qa_7d}. If missing, return zeros with a note.
- GET /api/release-captain?dry=true|false → shell out to scripts/release_captain.py (use dry=true default); capture JSON and return it. Timeout 60s, safe errors.

3) DASHBOARD (frontend)
- Create/overwrite /dashboard (serve dashboard.html).
- Build a simple responsive UI with:
  * Password field for Dashboard Key (not stored; sent as header X-Dashboard-Key on each request).
  * Buttons: Check Health, Supervisor Status, Send Pulse, Create Test Job, Refresh Jobs, Flip to Paid (asks for page_id), Metrics Summary, Run Full Validation.
  * A log area that pretty-prints request + response JSON and disables buttons while pending.
- NEVER include secrets or env in HTML/JS.

4) DAILY HEALTH SCRIPT
- Add scripts/health_check.sh (bash, executable):
  * Calls /health, /api/supervisor-status, /api/pulse, /api/job-log-latest with header X-Dashboard-Key:$DASHBOARD_KEY (read from env).
  * Sleep 30s between Notion reads to offset sync lag.
  * Write combined JSON to logs/daily_health_$(date +%F).json.
  * Echo summary line: "✅ [DATE] Health OK | QA:<n>% | Pulse:created" or a clear ❌ line; exit 1 on any failure.

5) LOGS
- Ensure these files are created/appended:
  logs/full_cycle.log
  logs/e2e_validation.json
  logs/release_captain.json
  logs/daily_health_*.json
- Do not break existing bot/processor.py or prior routes.

6) TEST (from dashboard)
- With correct Dashboard Key:
  * /health returns ok:true
  * /api/supervisor-status returns ok:true
  * /api/pulse returns ok:true with id
  * /api/create-test-job returns ok:true
  * After 60–90s, /api/job-log-latest returns ok:true with QA and finance fields
  * /api/metrics-summary returns ok:true
  * /api/release-captain returns ok:true (dry)
- With wrong key, all /api/* return 401 with {"ok": false, "error": "Unauthorized - invalid dashboard key"}.

7) COMMIT
Commit with message: "Phase 24: secure Ops Dashboard, metrics summary, daily health, validation API"

Finally, print:
- Modified file list
- Dashboard URL (/dashboard)
- A quick test transcript (one success JSON per endpoint).
