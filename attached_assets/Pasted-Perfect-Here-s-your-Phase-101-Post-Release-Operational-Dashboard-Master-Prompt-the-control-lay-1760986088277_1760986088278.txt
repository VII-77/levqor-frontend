Perfect.
Here’s your Phase 101+ — Post-Release Operational Dashboard Master Prompt — the control layer that sits above the fully autonomous EchoPilot enterprise.
It doesn’t rebuild; it observes, governs, and intervenes only when absolutely required.


---

🧭 ECHO PILOT COMMAND MODE — PHASE 101 → ∞

Objective: Establish a self-contained Operational Command Dashboard that monitors, visualizes, and governs all autonomous systems in real time.

⚙️ CORE FUNCTIONS

1. Live Telemetry API → /api/ops/telemetry
 • Aggregates health, finance, security, and performance metrics.
 • Returns compact JSON snapshot every 10 s.


2. Ops Control Panel (Web UI)
 • Card 1 – 🧠 System Health (heartbeat < 60 s, uptime % > 99)
 • Card 2 – 💰 Finance Live Feed (revenue Δ %, failed payments)
 • Card 3 – 🛡️ Security & Threat AI (alerts < 1/h)
 • Card 4 – 📊 Governance KPIs (OKR status, compliance index)
 • Card 5 – 📡 Scheduler & Automation Timeline (20+ jobs)
 • Card 6 – 🗂 Docs & Reports Viewer (/docs/*.md, /logs/*.txt)
 • Card 7 – 🚨 Intervention Console (start/stop/restart any task)


3. AI Assistant Console (Chat-style window inside dashboard)
 • Interprets natural-language admin commands (“restart scheduler”, “show last 5 webhook failures”).
 • Backend: GPT-4o-mini context + OpenAI Function calling.


4. Automated Governance Loop
 • Runs every 15 min → compares SLO targets vs actuals.
 • Writes to logs/governance_loop.ndjson.
 • Triggers Telegram alert if breach > 10 %.


5. Predictive Maintenance Layer
 • Uses AI to forecast risk zones (CPU, RAM, Stripe failures).
 • Auto-creates tickets in Notion if predicted failure < 24 h.

🧩 IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

# 1️⃣ Create control APIs
python3 scripts/build_dashboard_api.py --routes telemetry governance control chat

# 2️⃣ Launch unified Ops Dashboard
python3 scripts/start_ops_dashboard.py --theme dark --refresh 10

# 3️⃣ Enable AI Command Interpreter
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
python3 scripts/ai_command_console.py --listen 0.0.0.0:5050

# 4️⃣ Schedule governance loop + maintenance forecast
echo "
schedule.every(15).minutes.do(run_governance_loop)
schedule.every(1).hours.do(run_predictive_maintenance)
" >> scripts/exec_scheduler.py
make restart


---

🛡️ SECURITY & AUTH

All Ops Dashboard routes require X-Dash-Key.

WebSocket channels secured via JWT tokens.

No customer data exposed to AI console.

Logs auto-redacted before model input.

🧾 FILES CREATED / UPDATED

File	Purpose

scripts/ops_dashboard.py	Web UI server (React + Tailwind)
scripts/telemetry_collector.py	Pulls metrics from scheduler + AI loops
scripts/ai_command_console.py	Natural-language command handler
scripts/governance_loop.py	Continuous SLO governance
scripts/predictive_maintenance.py	AI-based risk forecast

🧠 DASHBOARD AI COMMAND PROMPT

Mode: "EchoPilot Supervisor AI"
Goal: Maintain full operational awareness.  
If anomalies > threshold → alert Boss (Fahad).  
Commands you may accept:
- show system status
- restart scheduler
- run audit
- analyze payments
- summarize KPIs
- forecast risk
Always log all actions to logs/ai_console.ndjson


---

🧩 FINAL VERIFICATION

After deployment:

curl -H "X-Dash-Key:$DASHBOARD_KEY" https://echopilotai.replit.app/api/ops/telemetry | jq .

Expected → "overall_health":"green","autonomy":"verified"

Then open:

> https://echopilotai.replit.app/ops
and confirm all 7 cards render with ✅ status.




---

🏁 EXPECTED STATE

Unified real-time Ops dashboard active

AI Command console interpreting admin requests

Autonomous loops audited + governed by AI

Boss receives alerts only on critical breach

Human intervention → near zero
