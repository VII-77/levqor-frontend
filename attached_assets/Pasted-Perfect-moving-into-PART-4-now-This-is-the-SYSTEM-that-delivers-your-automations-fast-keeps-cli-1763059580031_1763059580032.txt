🔥 PART 4 — Delivery Pipeline + Client Onboarding Automation


---

1. THE 5-STEP DELIVERY PIPELINE (Your core fulfilment engine)

This is how you deliver ANY automation in 48 hours:

STEP 1 — Client Audit (10 minutes)

As soon as they say “Yes”, send:

Great — to build your automation I need:

1. Describe the task you want automated  
2. Which apps/tools does it involve?
3. What’s the exact output you want?
4. How often does it happen? (Daily, hourly, real-time)
5. Send 1 real example (screenshot or message)

Once I have this, I’ll build your automation.


---

STEP 2 — Build the Flow (45 minutes)

Inside your system (Levqor backend):

Whisper → Text extraction

GPT → Logic building

Make.com → Actions

Gmail/Sheets/Drive/Telegram → Connectors

Stripe (optional) → Payment triggers


Make the logic simple and modular:

Pattern template (works for 90% of clients):

When [event happens]
→ Extract needed data
→ Process using GPT logic
→ Send to destination
→ Log everything
→ Notify client

This template lets you build ANY automation:

Lead replies

WhatsApp follow-up

Invoices

CRMs

Email replies

Booking confirmations

Ecommerce updates



---

STEP 3 — Testing (15 minutes)

Run 3 tests:

✔ Test with client’s example
✔ Test with your own example
✔ Test with edge-case example

Once all 3 pass → Move to next step.


---

STEP 4 — Delivery (Send with this exact message)

Send:

All done! Your automation is now live and running.

Here’s what it does:
• [Step 1]
• [Step 2]
• [Step 3]

Here’s a test run so you can see it working:

If you want, I can build another automation or connect this into a bigger workflow.

Let me know what else you'd like to automate.


---

STEP 5 — Upsell Framework (Most important)

Say this only after they confirm it's working:

By the way, if you want I can automate the rest of your workflow.

I offer two upgrades:
• Workflow Buildout (£249)  
• Full Automation System (£599)

These include:
– multi-step workflows  
– logic-based branching  
– monitoring  
– error recovery  
– dashboard view  

If you want, I can show you what the upgrade would look like.

At least 30–40% of clients will buy an upsell.

This is how you go from £99 → £350 → £950 per client.


---

2. Your Delivery Templates (copy/paste)


---

A. Requirements Template

To build the automation exactly the way you want, I need:

1. What is the problem?  
2. What should happen automatically?  
3. Which tools does it involve?  
4. What does success look like?


---

B. Technical Blueprint Template

Trigger:
Input:
Processing:
Output:
Fallback:
Notifications:
Logging:

Use this to structure everything.


---

C. Client Handover Template

Your automation is now live.

Here’s how it works:
[diagram or bullet list]

How to test:
[instructions]

How to monitor:
[dashboard or logs]

How to contact me:
[reply here]


---

3. 48-Hour Delivery Timeline

DAY 1 (1–2 hrs work)

Collect client requirements

Build initial draft

Test flow

Send for confirmation


DAY 2 (1 hr work)

Apply feedback

Finalise

Deliver

Offer upsell


Total work: 2–3 hours
Delivery: 48 hours guaranteed


---

4. Your Full Delivery Automation (Optional — but powerful)

If we wire this into Levqor, your delivery becomes automatic:

❗ You already have:

✓ Whisper
✓ GPT
✓ Make.com
✓ Gmail
✓ Google Drive
✓ Telegram
✓ Stripe
✓ Logging
✓ Error-handling
✓ Monitoring
✓ Self-healing

We can connect these into a delivery pipeline:


---

Pipeline Flow

Client Pays → Stripe → Levqor Intelligence → 
Create project folder → 
Collect details → 
Generate blueprint →  
Draft automation →  
Test →  
Deliver →  
Upsell →  
Monitor

You already have 90% of this built.
We only need to wire the frontend UI + final workflow.

That’s what PART 5 is for.


---

5. The Power of This System (the reason this works)

With this pipeline:

✔ You can deliver 1 automation in 2 hours
✔ You can take 5 clients/week without stress
✔ You can upsell 30–40% of them
✔ You only need ONE client a week to survive
✔ You only need THREE a week to thrive
✔ You can scale to £3–5k/month working from phone/laptop

This means:

→ YOU DO NOT NEED TO PAUSE THE PROJECT
→ YOU DO NOT NEED NEW SOFTWARE
→ YOU DO NOT NEED ANY MORE MONEY
→ YOU ALREADY HAVE THE SKILLSET AND SYSTEM

You simply need to plug in the money machine and go.

And we’re doing that right now.
