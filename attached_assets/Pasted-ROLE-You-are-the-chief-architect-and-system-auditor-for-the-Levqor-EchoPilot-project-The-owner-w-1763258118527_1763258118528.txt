ROLE
You are the chief architect and system auditor for the Levqor + EchoPilot project.

The owner wants a BRUTAL, COMPLETE INVENTORY of everything we have built so far, across backend, frontend, EchoPilot engine, docs, reports, and scripts.

Your job is:
1) To find EVERY relevant asset.
2) To classify whether it is actively used, owner-only, or legacy/unused.
3) To produce clear, beginner-friendly markdown reports explaining what exists and what matters.

You MUST respect the following constraints:
- Do NOT modify or delete any code, configs, or data.
- Do NOT change environment variables or secrets.
- Do NOT touch Stripe, Vercel, Cloudflare, or DNS config.
- Your primary output is documentation in markdown.
- You may ONLY create/overwrite markdown files and scratch notes.
- You MUST verify “used vs unused” with real, concrete checks (grep, references, imports, routes, etc.), not guesses.

====================================================================
CONTEXT (FACTS)
====================================================================

Project layout (from previous work, do NOT assume exact paths – detect them):

- Backend:
  - Flask + SQLAlchemy app (run.py, backend/…)
  - EchoPilot engine (monitors, schedulers, health checks, etc.)
  - Stripe integration, webhooks, Resend, Telegram, error monitoring.
  - Knowledge base and reports:
    - knowledge-base/*.md
    - integrity_reports/, archive/, etc.

- Frontend:
  - Next.js 14 App Router in levqor-site/
  - 26-page marketing site + legal pages + dashboard
  - Support AI chat components and client
  - Owner pages: /owner/handbook, /owner/errors

- Docs:
  - A lot of reports created over time: LAUNCH decisions, audits, nuclear reports, etc.

You must discover the actual paths and filenames by searching the repo.

====================================================================
GOAL
====================================================================

Produce, at minimum, the following files at the REPO ROOT (NOT inside levqor-site):

1) ECHOPILOT-ASSET-INVENTORY.md
   - A COMPLETE list of assets (code, jobs, endpoints, pages, reports, scripts).
   - Grouped by:
     - Backend code
     - EchoPilot engine (jobs, monitors, health scripts)
     - Frontend (pages, components, lib)
     - Integrations (Stripe, Resend, Telegram, error monitoring)
     - Reports & docs
     - Scripts & utilities
   - For each asset:
     - Name/path
     - Type (endpoint, page, job, script, report, etc.)
     - Short description

2) ECHOPILOT-USED-VS-UNUSED.md
   - A classification of each asset into:
     - ACTIVE (used in live system for customers or core operations)
     - OWNER-ONLY (used only by you as the owner/admin)
     - LEGACY/UNUSED (no longer wired anywhere, kept only for history)
   - Include for each:
     - Asset path
     - Category (active / owner-only / legacy)
     - Evidence of usage (how you checked)
     - Recommendation:
       - “Keep – core feature”
       - “Keep – internal/owner only”
       - “Consider archive”
       - “Safe to delete later (after manual backup)”

3) ECHOPILOT-ASSET-SUMMARY.md
   - A beginner-friendly summary (written for the non-technical owner) including:
     - Big-picture explanation of what exists.
     - Bullet list of “What’s actively used today”.
     - Bullet list of “What is owner-only / reference-only”.
     - Bullet list of “What is legacy and can be removed later”.
     - Clear note that NOTHING is silently lost: everything is either used, owner-only, or explicitly marked legacy.

====================================================================
PHASE 1 – DISCOVER ALL ASSETS (READ-ONLY)
====================================================================

1. From repo root, scan for key directories and files:

   - List top-level structure:
     - `ls`
   - Discover code trees:
     - `find backend -maxdepth 6 -type f | sort` (if backend/ exists)
     - `find monitors -maxdepth 6 -type f | sort` (if monitors/ exists)
     - `find modules -maxdepth 6 -type f | sort` (if modules/ exists)
     - `find scripts -maxdepth 6 -type f | sort` (if scripts/ exists)
     - `find levqor-site -maxdepth 6 -type f | sort` (frontend)
   - Discover docs/reports:
     - `find . -maxdepth 6 -type f -name '*.md' | sort`
     - Pay special attention to:
       - Any *LAUNCH*, *REALITY*, *NUCLEAR*, *HEALTH*, *AUDIT*, *REPORT* files.

2. DO NOT modify files in this phase. Just build an internal list of:

   - Backend routes
   - EchoPilot jobs, monitors, scripts
   - Frontend routes (Next.js pages)
   - Supporting libraries (`src/lib/*.ts`)
   - Integrations (Stripe, Resend, Telegram, error monitoring)
   - All markdown docs and reports.

====================================================================
PHASE 2 – VERIFY USAGE (CODE REFERENCES)
====================================================================

For each category, verify usage with REAL checks:

1. Backend endpoints:
   - Use `rg` (ripgrep) to find where each route function or blueprint is registered.
   - Check import and registration patterns in run.py or equivalent.
   - Mark an endpoint ACTIVE if:
     - It is registered on the app AND
     - It is called by frontend, jobs, Stripe, or external integrations.

2. EchoPilot jobs & monitors:
   - Inspect monitors/scheduler.py (or equivalent).
   - List all jobs registered.
   - For each:
     - Job function name
     - Trigger (cron/interval)
     - Purpose (health check, Stripe, DB, error monitoring, etc.)
   - Mark ACTIVE if it is currently registered and runs on the live scheduler.

3. Frontend routes:
   - Enumerate Next.js pages:
     - `find levqor-site/src/app -maxdepth 6 -name "page.tsx" -o -name "page.jsx"`.
   - For each page:
     - Determine URL path from folder structure.
     - Mark ACTIVE if:
       - It is part of the 26-page marketing+core list, OR
       - It is used as part of dashboard or support flows.
     - Mark OWNER-ONLY if:
       - It’s under `/owner/` or similar internal paths.

4. Components and libs:
   - For selected important components (support chat, pricing, etc.), use `rg` to find where they’re imported.
   - Only classify them as unused if they truly have no import references.

5. Docs & reports:
   - For markdown files, search references in code or other docs.
   - Classify:
     - ACTIVE DOC: linked from owner pages or referenced in other important docs.
     - OWNER-ONLY: relevant for you but not wired to code.
     - LEGACY: old nuclear reports, superseded audits, one-off diagnostics.

====================================================================
PHASE 3 – BUILD ECHOPILOT-ASSET-INVENTORY.md
====================================================================

Create `ECHOPILOT-ASSET-INVENTORY.md` at repo root with:

1. Title + date.
2. Sections:
   - Backend Code
   - EchoPilot Engine (Schedulers, Monitors, Health Scripts)
   - Frontend (Pages, Components, Lib)
   - Integrations (Stripe, Resend, Telegram, Error Monitoring)
   - Knowledge Base & Marketing Docs
   - Reports & Audits
   - Scripts & Utilities

3. In each section, a table with columns:
   - Asset
   - Type
   - Path
   - Short Description

Be concise but complete: everything relevant must appear at least once.

====================================================================
PHASE 4 – BUILD ECHOPILOT-USED-VS-UNUSED.md
====================================================================

Create `ECHOPILOT-USED-VS-UNUSED.md` with:

1. Brief intro explaining the categories:

   - ACTIVE – used in live system for customers or core operations.
   - OWNER-ONLY – not user-facing, but important for you (monitoring, audits, scripts).
   - LEGACY/UNUSED – old, not wired in, safe to archive later.

2. For each asset from the inventory, add a row in a table:

   Columns:
   - Asset
   - Path
   - Category (ACTIVE / OWNER-ONLY / LEGACY)
   - Evidence of usage (1–2 short phrases, e.g. “used by /pricing page”, “registered in scheduler”, “called by Stripe webhook”)
   - Recommendation (“Keep – core feature”, “Keep – owner-only”, “Consider archive later”, etc.)

3. Pay attention to:
   - Old folders like levqor-backend/, levqor-fresh/, levqor-frontend/ if they exist:
     - These are likely LEGACY if not referenced anywhere else now.
   - Old nuclear reports, old audit logs:
     - Mark as LEGACY unless explicitly linked.

====================================================================
PHASE 5 – BUILD ECHOPILOT-ASSET-SUMMARY.md (OWNER-FRIENDLY)
====================================================================

Create `ECHOPILOT-ASSET-SUMMARY.md` with:

1. A simple title and today’s date.
2. A plain-English explanation (4–8 sentences) of:
   - What Levqor + EchoPilot contains (backend, frontend, engine).
   - What is actually used now.
   - What exists only for you as the owner.
   - What is legacy and can be archived later.

3. Three main sections:

   A) “What is actively used today”
      - Bullet list of:
        - Core backend pieces (webhooks, health checks, error monitoring).
        - Core frontend pages (/, /pricing, /dfy, /dashboard, /support, /faq, 26 marketing pages).
        - Core EchoPilot jobs (health, Stripe, DB, error monitoring).
        - Support AI flows (even with graceful fallback).

   B) “What is internal / owner-only”
      - Bullet list of:
        - Owner pages (/owner/handbook, /owner/errors).
        - Launch decision reports.
        - Health & audit reports.
        - Scripts you might run occasionally (healthcheck, integrity tests).

   C) “What is legacy and can be archived later”
      - Bullet list of:
        - Old folders (levqor-backend, levqor-fresh, levqor-frontend) if unreferenced.
        - Old nuclear reports and one-off diagnostics superseded by newer ones.

4. End with a short clear statement confirming:
   - Nothing has been silently dropped.
   - Everything either powers the live system, supports you as owner, or is explicitly marked as legacy.

====================================================================
PHASE 6 – SANITY CHECK & NO-TOUCH GUARANTEE
====================================================================

1. Confirm you have NOT:
   - Modified backend behavior.
   - Changed any environment variables.
   - Touched pricing, products, or Stripe config.
   - Modified Vercel/Cloudflare/DNS.

2. If you needed any scratch notes, keep them under:
   - `archive/asset-audit-notes-*.md`

3. At the end, print this exact line to the Replit console:

   "EchoPilot asset inventory and used-vs-unused analysis complete – open ECHOPILOT-ASSET-SUMMARY.md first for the big picture."
