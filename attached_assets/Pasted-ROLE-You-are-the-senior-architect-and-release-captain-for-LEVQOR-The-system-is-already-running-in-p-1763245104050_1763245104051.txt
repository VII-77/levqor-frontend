ROLE
You are the senior architect and release captain for LEVQOR. The system is already running in production. Your job is to produce a SINGLE, HONEST GO / NO-GO decision for accepting real customers and money.

CONTEXT (FACTS)
- There is ONE active Replit project: Levqor-backend (backend + EchoPilot brain).
- Frontend is deployed on Vercel at: https://www.levqor.ai
- Backend autoscale domain: https://levqor-backend.replit.app
- Public API domain (via Cloudflare): https://api.levqor.ai
- /health and /api/stripe/check are already known to be working.
- Stripe webhook integration has been tested and fixed with pool_pre_ping.
- Database stability has been tested and is stable.
- The owner is non-technical. Output MUST be clear, plain English.

MANDATORY RULES
- Use existing integrations and secret environment variables AUTOMATICALLY. Do NOT create new secrets. Do NOT hardcode secrets.
- Do NOT change business logic, schema, or pricing.
- Do NOT delete files or break any deployment config.
- Your primary deliverable is a report, not new code.
- Verify everything with REAL commands: curl, python checks, logs. Never assume.

GOAL
Produce a single file at repo root:

  LEVQOR-LAUNCH-DECISION.md

This file must contain, in simple English:

- OVERALL: GO / NO-GO
- A 1-paragraph summary any beginner can understand.
- A table of checks (PASS / FAIL / WARNING) with short reasons.
- Clear “What you can safely do now” and “What you should watch”.

====================================================================
PHASE 1 – COLLECT EXISTING EVIDENCE (READ-ONLY)
====================================================================

1. From repo root, look for these existing reports (if present):
   - ECHOPILOT-FINAL-HEALTH-SUMMARY.md
   - BACKEND-DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md
   - FRONTEND-API-CONNECTIVITY.md
   - STRIPE-CHECK-ENDPOINT-REPORT.md
   - STRIPE-WEBHOOK-FINAL-REPORT.md
   - DB-STABILITY-REPORT.md
   - DB-CONNECTION-OVERVIEW.md
   - Any *PRODUCTION-REALITY* or *NUCLEAR-AUDIT* reports.

2. DO NOT modify these files. Just read them and extract:
   - Most recent verdicts for:
     - Backend health
     - Stripe check
     - Webhook logic
     - DB stability
     - Scheduler jobs
     - Support AI

3. Create a small scratch summary in memory (not a file yet) with:
   - “What is already proven working”
   - “What was previously failing and has been fixed”

====================================================================
PHASE 2 – LIVE RUNTIME CHECKS (NO CODE CHANGES)
====================================================================

Run the following commands from the Replit shell. Capture outputs and status codes.

HEALTH + STRIPE

1) Backend health via public domain:
   - curl -s -o- -w "\n%{http_code}\n" https://api.levqor.ai/health

2) Stripe integration check:
   - curl -s -o- -w "\n%{http_code}\n" https://api.levqor.ai/api/stripe/check

SUPPORT AI

3) Support AI health (if endpoint exists):
   - First try: curl -s -o- -w "\n%{http_code}\n" https://api.levqor.ai/api/support/health
   - If 404, note that and skip (do NOT treat as fatal).

SCHEDULER / ECHOPILOT

4) If there is an internal health/scheduler endpoint (e.g. /internal/health, /internal/scheduler/health, /api/intelligence/status):
   - curl those endpoints similarly.
   - Record status and JSON if any.

FRONTEND CONNECTIVITY (OBSERVED FROM BACKEND)

5) Check frontend availability:
   - curl -s -I https://www.levqor.ai
   - curl -s -I https://www.levqor.ai/pricing

You are ONLY observing here; do not modify any frontend code.

For EACH of these checks, note:
- HTTP status code
- Whether JSON/body content looks sane

====================================================================
PHASE 3 – MINIMAL LOG + DB SANITY
====================================================================

Without changing models or schema:

1) Open a Python shell to test DB quickly using the existing models/session:
   - Import the DB session and one key model, e.g. DFYOrder (or equivalent).
   - Run:
     - A simple “count orders” query (like .count() or len(query.all()) limited).
   - Confirm:
     - Query runs without errors.
     - Connection does not throw SSL or OperationalError.

2) If any error appears:
   - Capture the error type and message.
   - Do NOT attempt migrations or destructive operations.

====================================================================
PHASE 4 – SUPPORT AI + TICKETS (OPTIONAL BUT RELEVANT)
====================================================================

If support endpoints exist (as built earlier):

1) Test public support AI (with a very small question):
   - curl -s -o- -w "\n%{http_code}\n" \
     -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message":"Test: can I get help?"}' \
     https://api.levqor.ai/api/support/public

2) If this returns 200 with JSON, mark Support AI as “reachable”.

If any of these endpoints don’t exist (404), simply record that.
Do NOT treat missing support AI as a hard NO-GO, only as a WARNING.

====================================================================
PHASE 5 – BUILD LEVQOR-LAUNCH-DECISION.md
====================================================================

Now create or overwrite:

  LEVQOR-LAUNCH-DECISION.md

Structure:

1) TITLE + DATE
   - “Levqor Launch Readiness Decision”
   - Date/time in UTC

2) OVERALL DECISION (TOP, BOLD)
   - Either:
     - OVERALL: GO – Safe to accept real customers and payments.
     - OVERALL: GO WITH CAUTION – Safe for small, controlled live use (1–5 customers) with monitoring.
     - OVERALL: NO-GO – Do NOT accept real customers yet.
   - Choose ONE and justify in 2–3 clear sentences a beginner can understand.

3) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (BEGINNER-FRIENDLY)
   - 4–6 bullet points in simple English:
     - Example:
       - “The backend is up and responding correctly.”
       - “Stripe payments are configured and our own test order was saved in the database.”
       - “The database is stable enough for real use.”
       - “The support AI is available / not available.”
       - “We should start with small traffic and watch logs.”

4) CHECKLIST TABLE

   A markdown table with columns:
   - Area
   - Status (PASS / WARNING / FAIL)
   - Evidence (very short)
   - Impact

   Rows at least for:
   - Backend health (api.levqor.ai/health)
   - Stripe configuration (api/stripe/check)
   - Stripe webhook end-to-end (from STRIPE-WEBHOOK-FINAL-REPORT + latest test)
   - Database stability (from DB-STABILITY-REPORT + current DB sanity check)
   - Scheduler / EchoPilot jobs
   - Support AI (if reachable)
   - Frontend reachability (www.levqor.ai/pricing)
   - DNS / SSL (observation from curl)

5) WHAT IS SAFE TO DO NOW
   - A short section:
     - If GO or GO WITH CAUTION:
       - “You can safely take small real payments now (1–5 customers), starting with the cheapest plan.”
       - “You should watch Stripe dashboard and Replit logs after each payment.”
     - If NO-GO:
       - “Do NOT take real payments yet.”
       - “Fix the items marked as FAIL before proceeding.”

6) REMAINING RISKS / WATCHLIST
   - Bullet list of:
     - Any WARNINGS you found (e.g. support AI 404, missing endpoint, minor logs).
     - For each: what to watch and what to do if it becomes a problem.

7) CLEAR OWNER ACTIONS
   - Write a short, numbered list aimed at a non-technical owner:
     - “1. Start with one real payment using the cheapest plan.”
     - “2. After payment, check Stripe webhook log for 200 OK.”
     - “3. Confirm a new order appears in the dashboard / DB.”
     - “4. Confirm welcome and intake emails were received.”
     - “5. If anything fails, pause and contact your technical helper.”

====================================================================
