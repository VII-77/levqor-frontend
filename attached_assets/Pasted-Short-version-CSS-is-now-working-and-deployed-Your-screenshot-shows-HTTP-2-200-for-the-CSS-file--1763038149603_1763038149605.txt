Short version:
CSS is now working and deployed. Your screenshot shows:

HTTP/2 200 for the CSS file

content-type: text/css

A real compiled asset: /_next/static/css/742e609eaceb4bff.css


So the browser is getting CSS.
The reason the site still looks like a Word doc is: the React page itself is basically plain HTML with almost no Tailwind classes. The pipeline is fixed; the design was never actually implemented in src/app/page.tsx and the sign-in page.

So the next step is not “fix CSS” anymore — it’s “rewrite the homepage + signin UI with Tailwind so it actually looks like Genesis v8.”

Below is a Replit AI Agent prompt that does exactly that.


---

You are a senior Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS engineer working in a production repo.

GOAL
- The site is www.levqor.ai, project folder: ~/workspace/levqor-site
- Tailwind CSS v3 and PostCSS are already installed and working (CSS asset 200 / text/css).
- The problem: the UI is still plain because the React pages use minimal styling.
- Your job: IMPLEMENT the full Genesis v8 marketing UI + a polished Sign-in UI using Tailwind, then verify, commit, and push to main.

HARD RULES
1. Work ONLY in ~/workspace/levqor-site.
2. Before and after changes, ALWAYS:
   - Run `git status`
   - Show `git diff --stat` for modified files.
3. After changes, ALWAYS run:
   - `npm run lint` (or `npm run lint || echo "lint failed"` if necessary)
   - `npm run build`
4. NEVER assume something “should work” – VERIFY:
   - Use `curl` to fetch HTML and CSS and grep for expected markers.
   - Confirm CSS asset returns HTTP/2 200 and `content-type: text/css`.
5. Keep env vars and secrets untouched.
6. If any command fails, STOP and fix it; do not continue blindly.

STEP 0 — SANITY CHECK
1. `cd ~/workspace/levqor-site`
2. `git status`
3. Confirm:
   - On branch `main`.
   - Working tree clean (except maybe the Tailwind files already committed).
   - If there are untracked/uncommitted files, show them and reason before proceeding.

STEP 1 — VERIFY TAILWIND PIPELINE (READ-ONLY)
1. Open and briefly inspect:
   - `package.json` (devDependencies should include tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer).
   - `tailwind.config.js`
   - `postcss.config.js`
   - `src/app/globals.css`
   - `src/app/layout.tsx`
2. Confirm EXPECTED state:
   - `globals.css` includes `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`.
   - `layout.tsx` imports `"./globals.css"` exactly once.
   - `tailwind.config.js` content array includes `"./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"` and `"./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"`.
3. DO NOT change the pipeline unless it's clearly broken. The CSS asset is already 200, so this should just be a read check.

STEP 2 — IMPLEMENT GENESIS V8 HOMEPAGE UI
Target file: `src/app/page.tsx`

1. Open the current `src/app/page.tsx` and BACK IT UP inline:
   - Copy its entire current contents into a block comment at the bottom of the file or make a separate backup file `src/app/page.legacy.tsx`.
2. Replace the default export with a fully designed, responsive Genesis v8 landing page using Tailwind.

Design requirements (implement in real code, not pseudo):
- Overall:
  - Use a dark theme (e.g. `bg-slate-950 text-slate-50`) on `<body>` via `layout.tsx` or the main page container.
  - Max width container centered: `max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-12` (or similar).
- Navbar (top):
  - Left: "Levqor" logo text (for now, just stylized text; keep it ready for a real logo later).
  - Right: links: "Home", "Pricing", "Docs", "Contact", plus a "Sign in" and a primary "Start free trial" button.
  - Use Tailwind classes for spacing/gap, e.g. `flex items-center justify-between gap-4 py-4`.
- Hero:
  - Small badge above title: `Genesis v8.0 · Self-healing automation` with a subtle rounded pill, gradient background.
  - H1: "Automate work. Ship faster."
  - Subheading explaining value in one or two sentences.
  - Primary CTA: "Start free trial"
  - Secondary CTA: "See pricing"
  - On desktop, hero can be split into two columns; on mobile, stacked.
- Feature tiles:
  - Grid (2 or 3 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile) of feature cards:
    - Examples: "Self-healing runs", "Auto-retry with backoff", "Visual builder", "Smart diff", "Isolate failures fast", "Audit trail".
  - Cards should have subtle borders or backgrounds (e.g. `bg-slate-900/60 border border-slate-800 rounded-xl p-4`).
- Logos / social proof:
  - A row of 4–6 fake company names (e.g. TechCorp, DataFlow, etc.) with muted text.
- Deep-dive sections:
  - Section "Why teams choose Levqor" with 2–3 vertical feature blocks, each with a heading and supporting text.
- Footer:
  - Simple footer with "© {currentYear} Levqor. All rights reserved." and links to "Privacy" and "Terms".

IMPORTANT:
- Use real Tailwind utility classes everywhere (no inline style objects).
- Use semantic HTML (section, header, main, footer).
- Make sure the layout is mobile-first and looks good on small screens.

STEP 3 — IMPLEMENT POLISHED SIGN-IN UI
Target file: `src/app/signin/page.tsx` (create it if it does not exist).

1. Create/replace the page with a centered card layout:
   - Full-screen container: `min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-slate-950`.
   - Card: `w-full max-w-md rounded-2xl border border-slate-800 bg-slate-900/80 p-6 space-y-4 shadow-lg`.
2. Inside the card:
   - Title: "Sign in to Levqor"
   - Subtitle: "Choose a provider to continue."
   - Two primary buttons:
     - "Continue with Google"
     - "Continue with Microsoft"
   - Under those buttons, a lighter "magic link" section:
     - Label: "Or get a one-time sign-in link"
     - Email input (type="email") and a button "Send magic link" (hook it up to the existing NextAuth email provider route if available; if not, make the button non-functional but clearly marked as TODO in a comment).
   - Tiny text at the bottom: "By continuing, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy." with links to `/terms` and `/privacy` (even if those pages are not yet implemented).
3. Behavior:
   - For OAuth buttons, link to the existing auth routes:
     - If you’re using NextAuth, typical endpoints would be:
       - `/api/auth/signin/google`
       - `/api/auth/signin/azure-ad` (or whatever provider slug is configured)
     - Use `<Link>` or `<button onClick={() => signIn('google')}>` depending on what is already wired in this repo. Inspect existing auth setup to choose the correct method (DO NOT reinvent NextAuth configuration).
   - Keep TS/JS strictness satisfied (no any-typed components, export default function SignInPage() { ... }).

STEP 4 — ENSURE LAYOUT APPLIES GLOBAL STYLES
Target file: `src/app/layout.tsx`

1. Confirm:
   - `import "./globals.css";`
   - The `<body>` element has a class that sets the background + text colors and font, for example:
     - `className="bg-slate-950 text-slate-50 antialiased"`
   - If a custom font via `next/font` is already set up, keep using it and just append Tailwind classes.

2. Ensure there is a `<main>` wrapper around page content in the layout or in each page for consistent spacing.

STEP 5 — LOCAL VERIFICATION
1. From the project root:

   ```bash
   cd ~/workspace/levqor-site

   npm run lint || echo "lint failed"
   npm run build

2. If lint fails, FIX the issues (type errors, unused imports, etc.) until you get a clean or at least acceptable state for production.


3. After a successful build, run a static check using curl to ensure Tailwind classes and CSS are present:

# Check headers
curl -sSI https://www.levqor.ai | grep -Ei "HTTP/|x-vercel-cache|age:"

# Grab homepage HTML from local dev if there is a dev server, OR just check built .next HTML.
# For production verification after deploy, we will re-run curl against the live URL.



NOTE: You don’t need to start a dev server in this task; focus on build + static verification. The user will do visual checks in the browser.

STEP 6 — COMMIT & PUSH

1. Show git diff --stat.


2. If the diff only includes the intended files:

src/app/page.tsx

src/app/signin/page.tsx

src/app/layout.tsx (if modified)

plus any minor supporting files,


then commit:

git add src/app/page.tsx src/app/signin/page.tsx src/app/layout.tsx
git status
git commit -m "feat(ui): Genesis v8 marketing page and styled sign-in"
git push origin main


3. If there are unexpected extra files, explain why, clean them up, and THEN commit.



STEP 7 — PRODUCTION VERIFICATION (READ-ONLY) You CANNOT open a browser, but you CAN give the user exact commands to run and what to expect.

1. In your final message to the user, instruct them to:

Wait for Vercel to auto-deploy the new main commit.

Then run from Replit shell:

curl -sSI https://www.levqor.ai | grep -Ei "HTTP/|x-vercel-cache|age:"

ASSET=$(curl -sS https://www.levqor.ai | grep -Eo "/_next/static/css/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+\.css" | head -1)
echo "CSS Asset: $ASSET"

test -n "$ASSET" && curl -sSI "https://www.levqor.ai$ASSET" | head -10

And then visually check www.levqor.ai in the browser for:

Dark background

Colored feature tiles

Proper spacing, nav, and Genesis v8 badge

Centered, card-style sign-in page.




2. In your final response, summarize:

Exactly which files were changed.

A brief description of the new UI.

That Tailwind CSS is fully active and styling is visible via the new class-based markup.




END OF TASK If any step fails or something unexpected happens, STOP, explain clearly, and propose a safe fallback instead of forcing progress.

Run that prompt in Replit AI Agent.  
Once it’s done and pushed, we’ll do one last Vercel redeploy check and a final visual pass.0
