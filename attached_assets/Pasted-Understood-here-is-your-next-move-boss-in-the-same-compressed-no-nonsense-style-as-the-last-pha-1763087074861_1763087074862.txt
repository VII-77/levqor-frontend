Understood — here is your next move, boss, in the same compressed, no-nonsense style as the last phases.

NEXT STEP: FINAL LEGAL BLOCKERS (Stage 1, Items 3–7)

You already completed:

1. Cookie Banner


2. Terms Acceptance Flow



Now we tackle the remaining Stage 1 mandatory blockers before Levqor can legally go live:


---

🟥 STAGE 1 — CRITICAL COMPLIANCE BLOCKERS (Remaining Items)

All written for Replit Agent-style implementation later.

3. Marketing Consent System (PECR / GDPR)

What needs adding:

Double opt-in for any marketing emails

Store consent (timestamp, IP, method)

Update /privacy + /terms

Add unsubscribe link to all templates

Add /api/marketing/consent + /api/marketing/unsubscribe

Add marketing preferences page /settings/marketing



---

4. High-Risk Data Exclusion (Legal Liability)

What needs adding:

Global prohibition: no medical, legal, financial, or safety-critical automation

Add section to:

/risk-disclosure

/acceptable-use

/terms


Add frontend warning when creating workflows



---

5. ROPA — Record of Processing Activities (Documentation)

Internal document (not public):
Must include:

Data categories processed

Legal basis

Retention schedule

Internal recipients + sub-processors

Encryption + security overview

Risk scoring (low/medium/high)

Mitigations


You will store this in /docs/compliance/ropa.md.


---

6. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

Required because Levqor involves:

AI

Automation

Potential profiling

High-risk data entering logs


Content (very compressed):

Processing description

Risks

Likelihood & severity scale

Mitigations

Residual risk

Sign-off


Goes in /docs/compliance/dpia.md.


---

7. Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA)

Only required if you use legitimate interest as legal basis.
Since Levqor uses consent for marketing + contract for service, this is optional.
But good to have.

Contents:

Purpose test

Necessity test

Balancing test

Safeguards


File: /docs/compliance/lia.md.
