You are EchoPilot-Boss-Dev. Apply the following changes end-to-end.

GOAL
- Add cross-database metrics aggregation and a daily “System Pulse” log at 06:30 UTC.
- Expose /metrics and /pulse endpoints.
- Write pulse entries to Notion Governance Ledger.
- Zero downtime. Keep existing bot behavior.

CODE CHANGES
1) Create file metrics.py with:
- function get_metrics(notion) -> dict:
  - jobs_7d: count Job Log rows created within 7 days
  - avg_qa_7d: average QA over last 7 days (0 if none)
  - revenue_7d: sum Financial Tracker.Amount where Paid=true and Date within 7 days
  - roi_30d: average Cost Dashboard.ROI within last 30 days (0 if none)
  - uptime_pct: read last 7 days of /health pings from our logs (fallback 100 if none)
- function write_pulse(notion, metrics) -> pulse_id:
  - Create new Governance Ledger row:
    Title = f"System Pulse {today_UTC}"
    Notes = f"Jobs {jobs_7d} | QA {avg_qa_7d}% | Rev ${revenue_7d} | ROI {roi_30d}% | Uptime {uptime_pct}%"
    Severity = "Info"
    Source = "Ops Monitor"

2) In app.py (or main.py):
- add route GET /metrics -> returns JSON from get_metrics()
- add route POST /pulse?token=... -> if token==HEALTH_TOKEN then:
    m = get_metrics(notion); id = write_pulse(notion,m); return {"ok":true,"id":id,"metrics":m}
- keep existing imports; reuse Notion client you already use.

3) Scheduler (cron-like):
- In the main polling loop (or create scheduler.py), add a lightweight scheduler that runs once after 06:30 UTC each day:
  - if not already ran today -> HTTP POST to /pulse?token=$HEALTH_TOKEN (internal call) and log result.
- Ensure idempotency (only one pulse per day). Use a small file tmp/last_pulse_utc.txt to store the date.

4) Logging:
- Append each /health check result with timestamp to logs/health.ndjson (status:"ok"), keep 7 days.
- get_metrics() computes uptime as 100 * ok_count / total_count over last 7 days.

5) Env vars (read via existing config):
- GOVERNANCE_DB_ID (Notion Governance Ledger DB)
- HEALTH_TOKEN (already present)
- JOBLOG_DB_ID, FINANCE_DB_ID, COST_DB_ID (use your existing variable names; fallbacks:
  NOTION_JOB_DB_ID, NOTION_FINANCE_DB_ID, NOTION_COST_DB_ID)

6) Tests:
- Add GET /metrics smoke test (returns keys: jobs_7d, avg_qa_7d, revenue_7d, roi_30d, uptime_pct).
- Add POST /pulse?token=$HEALTH_TOKEN returns ok:true.

7) Procfile unchanged (gunicorn -w 2 -k gthread -t 120 app:app). No preload.

RUN & VERIFY (Ghostwriter should run these in Shell)
- curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/metrics" | python3 -m json.tool
- curl -X POST -fsS "$BASE_URL/pulse?token=$HEALTH_TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool

OUTPUT
- Create/overwrite file QUICK_METRICS_README.md explaining endpoints, envs, and daily schedule.
- Print final line: READY with endpoints.
