You are an expert Next.js + Tailwind developer. Implement a FULL GDPR + PECR compliant cookie consent system for Levqor.ai. Build it exactly as follows and apply it across the entire site.

===========================
FEATURE REQUIREMENTS
===========================

1) COOKIE BANNER (shows on first visit)
- Full-width bottom banner
- Text: “Levqor uses cookies to improve your experience. You can accept or reject non-essential cookies.”
- Buttons:
  • Accept All (primary)
  • Reject All (secondary)
  • Cookie Settings (opens modal)
- Do NOT load analytics scripts before consent.

2) COOKIE SETTINGS MODAL
- Four sections with toggles:
  • STRICTLY NECESSARY (always enabled, disabled toggle)
  • FUNCTIONAL COOKIES
  • ANALYTICS COOKIES
  • MARKETING COOKIES
- Buttons:
  • Save Preferences
  • Accept All
  • Reject All

3) STATE MANAGEMENT
Store the following in localStorage:
- consent: {
    necessary: true,
    functional: true/false,
    analytics: true/false,
    marketing: true/false,
    timestamp: ISO string,
    version: "1.0"
}

4) GLOBAL VISIBILITY LOGIC
- Banner only shows when:
  localStorage.consent does NOT exist OR version mismatch.
- Modal opens from banner or footer link (“Cookie Settings”).

5) SCRIPT LOADING RULES
Only load analytics if:
  consent.analytics === true

Implement wrappers such as:
• components/cookies/LoadAnalytics.tsx
• components/cookies/CookieBanner.tsx
• components/cookies/CookieModal.tsx

6) FOOTER UPDATE
Add “Cookie Settings” link → opens modal globally.

7) FILE CREATION
Create the following files:

/src/components/cookies/CookieBanner.tsx  
/src/components/cookies/CookieModal.tsx  
/src/components/cookies/LoadAnalytics.tsx  
/src/lib/cookies.ts  
/src/hooks/useCookieConsent.ts  
/src/app/cookie-settings/page.tsx (optional page version)  

Modify:
/src/app/layout.tsx → inject banner + modal provider  
/src/components/Footer.tsx → add “Cookie Settings” link  

8) STYLE REQUIREMENTS (Tailwind)
Banner:
  fixed bottom-0 w-full bg-slate-900 text-white p-4 border-t border-slate-700

Buttons:
  primary: bg-emerald-500 hover:bg-emerald-600 text-white
  secondary: bg-slate-700 hover:bg-slate-600 text-white

Modal:
  centered, max-w-lg, bg-slate-800, p-6, rounded-xl, shadow-xl

9) ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
- Focus trap
- ESC closes modal
- Tab navigation
- ARIA labels on buttons
- Screen-reader text for modal title

10) TESTING REQUIREMENTS
After implementation:
- First load → banner appears
- Accept All → analytics loads
- Reject All → analytics blocked
- Custom → only categories that are enabled load
- Refresh page → banner does NOT reappear if consent stored
- Delete localStorage → banner appears again
