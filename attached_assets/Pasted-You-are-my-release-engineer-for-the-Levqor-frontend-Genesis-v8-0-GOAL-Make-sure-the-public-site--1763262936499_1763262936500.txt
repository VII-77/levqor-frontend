You are my release engineer for the Levqor frontend (Genesis v8.0).

GOAL
Make sure the public site at https://www.levqor.ai is deploying the SAME code we have in the levqor-site project that contains:
- 26 marketing pages (About, Story, Team, How It Works, Tour, Demo, Transform, etc.)
- Owner pages: /owner/handbook and /owner/errors
- Updated FAQ and global language
- Pricing pages wired to the current plans

I do NOT see these updates live yet, so I want you to:

1) VERIFY LOCAL FRONTEND CODE
- cd into the levqor-site frontend project.
- Run `ls src/app` and confirm that these paths exist:
  - about, story, team, how-it-works, tour, demo, savings-calculator, transformation
  - pricing, dfy
  - faq, support, roadmap, integrations
  - solutions/* (ecommerce, agencies, coaches, creators, smb)
  - owner/handbook, owner/errors
- Also confirm that WEBSITE-INTEGRATION-STATUS.md and FRONTEND-TRANSFORMATION-COMPLETE.md exist at the correct path.
- Summarise in comments which of those paths exist so I know Genesis v8 really lives in THIS repo.

2) CHECK GIT STATUS
- Run `git status`.
- If there are UNCOMMITTED changes (modified or untracked files), list them.
- Then:
  - Stage all frontend changes related to Genesis v8 (src/app, src/components, src/lib, docs).
  - Commit them with a clear message, e.g. "Genesis v8 frontend – sync with production".
  - Push to the default remote and branch (likely `origin main`).
- If there are NO changes, just confirm the latest commit hash.

3) CONFIRM REPO VERCEL USES
- From the project files or docs (README, replit.md, WEBSITE-INTEGRATION-STATUS.md), confirm:
  - The GitHub repo and branch that the Vercel project "levqor-site" is hooked to.
  - Make sure it matches the remote we just pushed to.
- If there is any mismatch (e.g. Vercel using a different repo like levqor-frontend):
  - Write a short note in LEVQOR-FRONTEND-SYNC-NOTES.md at the repo root explaining:
    - Which repo/branch Vercel uses now,
    - Which repo/branch we just updated,
    - What I need to change in Vercel’s dashboard to point to the correct repo.
  - Do NOT try to change Vercel settings yourself; just document.

4) TRIGGER FRESH DEPLOY (IF POSSIBLE FROM CI)
- If this repo already has a Vercel Git integration (e.g. vercel.json or CI config):
  - Do NOT add new config.
  - Just confirm that pushing to main should automatically trigger a new Vercel deployment.
- In the comments to me:
  - Paste the latest commit hash on main after your push.
  - Tell me: “This is the commit hash you should see in the latest deploy on Vercel.”

5) VERIFY PRICING COPY VS CODE
- In levqor-site, search for pricing numbers:
  - grep for "£19", "19/mo", "£29", "29/mo", "£49", "£79".
- Summarise:
  - What numbers appear on /pricing and /dfy pages in the code,
  - Whether £19 appears anywhere in the frontend code.
- Do NOT change any prices in this step; just report findings so we can decide final pricing.

6) SANITY CHECK ROUTES
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` for levqor-site and confirm:
  - Build passes successfully,
  - Number of routes is ~115 (as in WEBSITE-INTEGRATION-STATUS.md).
- If build fails, STOP and show me the exact error; do not hack around it.

7) FINAL REPORT
At the end, create/overwrite a file at the repo root called:

  LEVQOR-FRONTEND-SYNC-REPORT.md

This file must, in plain English, include:
- Whether Genesis v8 pages (26 pages + owner pages) are present in code,
- Whether there were uncommitted changes and if they’re now pushed,
- The latest commit hash on main,
- Which GitHub repo/branch Vercel should be deploying,
- Any pricing discrepancies you found (e.g. £19 still in code, or not),
- Clear next steps for me in Vercel (if any).

Do NOT:
- Do not modify pricing values or business logic in this run.
- Do not touch backend, Stripe, or scheduler.
- Do not change environment variables.

Your job is to SYNC CODE → GIT and give me a crystal-clear report so I can ensure Vercel is deploying the right commit.
