You are the EchoPilot release captain. Apply all changes and produce one final JSON summary.

A) CONFIG: SINGLE WORKER + GUARDRAILS
1) Edit Procfile EXACTLY:
   web: gunicorn -w 1 -k gthread -t 120 app:app
2) Ensure/Set secrets (create if missing):
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   MAX_COST_USD_JOB=0.75
   MAX_TOKENS_JOB=300000
   # Stripe live (prompt me to paste if absent)
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_LIVE=sk_live_********
   STRIPE_WH_SECRET_LIVE=whsec_********
   STRIPE_MODE=live
3) Save, then clean-restart gunicorn (stop any stale workers). Confirm 1 worker active.

B) HEALTH BASELINE
1) Call /health and append a line to logs/health.ndjson.
2) Note: /supervisor, /forecast, /metrics, /pulse may 404 via Replit proxy; verify the Flask routes internally instead and proceed.

C) $1 LIVE PAYMENT SMOKE
1) In Notion “🧱 Automation Queue System”, create row:
   - Job Name: Go-Live $1 Charge
   - Task Type: Processing
   - Trigger: true
   - Status: New
   - Payload Link: https://filesamples.com/samples/audio/mp3/sample3.mp3
   - Owner Email: admin@echopilot.ai
2) Poll every 10s up to 120s for pickup. After it completes, WAIT 60s (Notion sync).

D) JOB LOG VERIFICATION (🎙️ EchoPilot Job Log)
1) Find the row with Job Name = "Go-Live $1 Charge".
2) Assert and capture these fields (use exact names in your schema):
   CID, QA, Duration Sec, Duration Min, Client Rate USD/min,
   Gross USD, Profit USD, Margin %, Payment Link, Payment Status,
   Drive Folder, Summary.
3) If Payment Link missing OR Stripe errors, capture exact runtime error text and continue.

E) PAYMENT → PAID + ROI
1) Open the Payment Link and complete a **$1 live** test payment (if automation cannot click, mark Payment Status = Paid after verifying Stripe shows a successful payment for $1).
2) In “💰 Cost Dashboard”, after save, WAIT 30–60s and read:
   - Revenue_30d
   - ROI
   Capture both values.

F) RESULT JSON (print only this object)
E2E_RESULT = {
  "status": "PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL",
  "reason": "<short reason>",
  "qa": <number or null>,
  "duration_sec": <number or null>,
  "gross_usd": <number or null>,
  "profit_usd": <number or null>,
  "margin_pct": <number or null>,
  "payment_link": "<url or null>",
  "payment_status": "<final status>",
  "roi_30d": "<value or null>",
  "governance_pulse": "created|skipped|error"
}

NOTES:
- Do NOT change any Notion schemas.
- If STRIPE live keys are missing, PROMPT ME to paste them, then continue.
- If an external endpoint 404s via Replit, verify with Flask test client internally and proceed.
- All model calls must use gpt-4o-mini.
