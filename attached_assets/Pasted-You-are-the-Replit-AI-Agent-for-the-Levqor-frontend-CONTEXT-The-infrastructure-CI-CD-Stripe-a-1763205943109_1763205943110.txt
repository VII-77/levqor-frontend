You are the Replit AI Agent for the Levqor frontend.

CONTEXT
- The infrastructure, CI/CD, Stripe, auth, and security are fully operational.
- The goal is now strictly: REVENUE.
- The user is a beginner; you must do the heavy lifting.
- You MUST NOT change core app logic or break the build.
- You MAY create or update content files (Markdown/MDX/TSX copy blocks) and documentation files.

PRIMARY GOAL
- Perform a focused MARKETING & REVENUE audit of the current app.
- Then generate a set of ready-to-use assets:
  - Sharper pricing/offers copy
  - A services/DFY page (if needed)
  - Email flows around Stripe checkout
  - Short-form video scripts
  - Reddit/community post drafts
  - A simple daily execution playbook

HARD RULES
- Do NOT change any config files (next.config, tsconfig, CI, etc.).
- Do NOT touch env variables or secrets.
- Do NOT remove or rename any components.
- Keep all changes additive or content-only.
- If you propose code changes, put them into new files OR as commented code snippets, not live changes, unless explicitly stated.

====================================================
SECTION 1 — DISCOVER CURRENT MARKETING SURFACE
====================================================

1. Confirm project root:
   - Run:
       pwd
       ls -la
   - If levqor-frontend exists and we are not inside it:
       cd levqor-frontend
       pwd
       ls -la

2. Find the main marketing/pricing surfaces:
   - Look for pages/components:
       ls -la src/app
       find src -maxdepth 4 -type f \( -name "*pricing*" -o -name "*landing*" -o -name "*hero*" -o -name "*services*" \) | sort
   - Show relevant key files:
       sed -n '1,200p' src/app/page.tsx 2>/dev/null || echo "No app root page.tsx"
       sed -n '1,200p' src/app/pricing/page.tsx 2>/dev/null || echo "No pricing page"
       sed -n '1,200p' src/app/services/page.tsx 2>/dev/null || echo "No services page"

3. Summarise in your own words:
   - What Levqor claims to do (value proposition).
   - How pricing is currently presented.
   - Whether there is a clear “DFY Automation” service explanation.
   - Where the Stripe buttons live in the UI.

====================================================
SECTION 2 — OFFER & FUNNEL AUDIT
====================================================

1. Based on the pricing page and any copy:
   - Identify all products and plans (DFY + subscriptions + add-ons).
   - For each, write:
       - Who it’s for (ideal customer).
       - Main outcome promised.
       - What they get in practical terms.
       - How they buy it (which button/flow).

2. Evaluate the funnel:
   - Is it clear what happens AFTER payment?
   - Is there an obvious next step (intake form / call)?
   - Are objections answered anywhere (FAQ, guarantees, clarity on timeline)?

3. Write a short “BRUTAL SUMMARY” of weaknesses:
   - e.g. “Good design but unclear promise”, “Buttons exist but no explanation of outcomes”, etc.

====================================================
SECTION 3 — CONTENT UPGRADE (COPY ONLY, NO LOGIC)
====================================================

Goal: Generate better sales messaging for pricing/services.

1. Create or update a documentation file:
   - Path:
       marketing/PRICING-COPY-LEVQOR.md
   - Write:
       - A clear H1 for the pricing page.
       - A 2–3 sentence value proposition for Levqor as “your AI automation team”.
       - For each DFY plan (Starter, Professional, Enterprise), write:
           - “For who”
           - 3–5 bullet benefits
           - What happens week 1 after purchase
       - For each subscription (Growth Monthly/Yearly), write:
           - Ongoing value (why keep paying)
           - What is delivered every month
           - Why this is cheaper than hiring staff

2. If there is no dedicated services page:
   - Create:
       marketing/SERVICES-PAGE-DRAFT.md
   - Include:
       - A “Done-For-You Automation Setup” hero section.
       - A 3-step process: (1) Pay, (2) Intake form, (3) Delivery.
       - A short FAQ: timelines, tools supported, refunds, support.

Do NOT wire this into routing; this is content only.

====================================================
SECTION 4 — POST-CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE (EMAILS & FLOW)
====================================================

Goal: Turn Stripe payments into a tight onboarding flow.

1. Create a file:
   - marketing/EMAIL-FLOWS.md

2. Inside it, write 4 email templates:

   a) “Payment Confirmation + Next Steps”
      - Subject line
      - Body:
          - Thank them.
          - Confirm which plan they bought.
          - Link to intake form (placeholder LINK_INTAKE_FORM).
          - Explain when they’ll hear back.

   b) “Intake Form Reminder” (if not submitted after 24–48h)
      - Short, polite nudge.

   c) “Pre-Call Prep” (for DFY plans with a call)
      - What they should bring (logins, examples, priorities).

   d) “Project Complete + Handover”
      - Summary of what was built.
      - Link to documentation / Loom (placeholder).
      - Upsell to subscription if they bought DFY only.

3. At the end of the file, write a simple flow diagram text:
   - “Payment → Confirmation Email → Intake Form → Call → Delivery → Handover + Upsell”.

====================================================
SECTION 5 — TOP-OF-FUNNEL ASSETS (TIKTOK + REDDIT)
====================================================

Goal: Give the user ready-made scripts they can record/post.

1. Create:
   - marketing/TIKTOK-SCRIPTS.md

   Include:
   - 5 short-form video scripts (15–30 seconds) targeting:
       - Solo founders drowning in admin.
       - Small agencies doing manual reporting.
       - Creators manually managing content.
   Each script must follow:
       - Hook (pain)
       - Quick demonstration or example
       - CTA to visit levqor.ai/pricing and buy DFY Starter.

2. Create:
   - marketing/REDDIT-POSTS.md

   Include:
   - 3 long-form value posts for subreddits like r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness, r/automation.
   - Each post must:
       - Tell a specific before/after automation story.
       - Describe time saved.
       - Invite comments WITHOUT sounding spammy.
       - Include a soft CTA at the end (“If anyone wants a similar setup, I do DFY builds – DM or see levqor.ai”).

====================================================
SECTION 6 — DAILY EXECUTION PLAYBOOK
====================================================

1. Create:
   - marketing/DAILY-REVENUE-PLAYBOOK.md

2. In that file, write a simple daily routine for the user, including:

   - “Every Morning”:
       - Check Stripe dashboard for new payments.
       - Check inbox for new leads/replies.
       - Respond to any DM or email in under 1 hour.

   - “Content Block (30–60 minutes)”:
       - Record 1 TikTok using one of the scripts.
       - Post it on TikTok/Shorts.
       - Paste 1 Reddit post or reply using the drafts.

   - “Client Delivery Block”:
       - Work through any DFY automations purchased.
       - Use a simple checklist (you can define it) to mark a project as “done”.

   - “Evening Review (10–15 minutes)”:
       - Log what was shipped.
       - Note which piece of content/offer seems to get interest.

Ensure this file is written in simple, actionable language so a beginner can follow it daily without thinking.

====================================================
SECTION 7 — FINAL SUMMARY (MANDATORY OUTPUT)
====================================================

At the end, print a clear summary in the console:

1. List all new/updated files you created, for example:
   - marketing/PRICING-COPY-LEVQOR.md
   - marketing/SERVICES-PAGE-DRAFT.md
   - marketing/EMAIL-FLOWS.md
   - marketing/TIKTOK-SCRIPTS.md
   - marketing/REDDIT-POSTS.md
   - marketing/DAILY-REVENUE-PLAYBOOK.md

2. For each file, 1–2 bullet points describing what it contains and how the user should use it.

3. A single short recommendation:
   - “Start by updating the pricing page with PRICING-COPY-LEVQOR.md, then use TIKTOK-SCRIPTS.md + REDDIT-POSTS.md this week to drive traffic.”
