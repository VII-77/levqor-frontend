You are the Replit AI Agent for the Levqor frontend.

GOAL
- Investigate the 3 non-critical build warnings reported in NUCLEAR-AUDIT-REPORT.md, especially those related to dynamic routes.
- Explain EXACTLY what each warning is, why it happens, and whether it is safe to ignore or should be fixed.
- Propose concrete, minimal fixes for each warning WITHOUT applying them automatically unless explicitly instructed at the end.

RULES
- Read first, DO NOT change any files until the “FIX PROPOSAL” step.
- Do not delete or rename files.
- Any suggested changes must be shown as diffs or code snippets, NOT applied directly.

====================================================
STEP 1 — FIND THE WARNINGS
====================================================

1. If NUCLEAR-AUDIT-REPORT.md exists, show only the warnings section:
   sed -n '1,200p' NUCLEAR-AUDIT-REPORT.md | sed -n '/Warnings/,$p' || echo "No report or warnings section found."

2. Re-run build to capture current warnings fresh:
   npm install
   npm run build 2>&1 | tee /tmp/build_warnings.log

3. Extract ONLY warnings from the log:
   grep -i "warn" /tmp/build_warnings.log | head -n 50 || echo "No warnings found."
   tail -n 80 /tmp/build_warnings.log

4. Summarise:
   - List each UNIQUE warning message.
   - For each, note the file(s) and route(s) mentioned.

====================================================
STEP 2 — CLASSIFY EACH WARNING
====================================================

For each warning found, classify:

- Type: e.g. “dynamic route without generateStaticParams”, “large route segment”, “experimental feature”, etc.
- Impact:
  - BLOCKING (build fails) – should not be the case
  - NON-BLOCKING BUT RISKY (may cause runtime bugs or 500s)
  - NON-BLOCKING + ACCEPTABLE (e.g. normal Next.js warnings)

Give a plain-English explanation for the impact:
- “This can cause SEO issues.”
- “This only affects performance in extreme cases.”
- “This is harmless noise given your current usage.”

====================================================
STEP 3 — INSPECT AFFECTED ROUTES/FILES
====================================================

For each file/route mentioned in the warnings:

1. Show the relevant file:
   - If it is a page or route (e.g. app/.../page.tsx, pages/...):
       sed -n '1,160p' <file_path>

2. Look for:
   - Dynamic segments: [id], [...slug], etc.
   - getStaticProps / getServerSideProps / generateStaticParams usage.
   - Any obvious anti-patterns flagged by Next.js docs.

3. Summarise:
   - What this route does.
   - Whether it’s core to your app (e.g. pricing, checkout, auth) or a secondary page.

====================================================
STEP 4 — FIX PROPOSALS (READ-ONLY)
====================================================

For EACH warning, propose a minimal, concrete fix:

- If the issue is “dynamic route without generateStaticParams”:
  - Suggest either:
    - Implementing generateStaticParams, OR
    - Explicitly marking it as dynamic (dynamic = 'force-dynamic' or similar) depending on how the route is intended to behave.

- If the issue is “too many dynamic segments” or similar:
  - Suggest:
    - Keeping as-is if it’s not impacting performance.
    - Or restructuring the route if easy and clearly beneficial.

- If it’s a minor Next.js warning that’s safe for your use case:
  - State clearly: “Safe to ignore for now. Optional improvement only.”

Produce:
- A bullet list of suggested changes per file, with code snippets like:

   File: app/example/[id]/page.tsx  
   Current:  
     (show the relevant part)  
   Suggested change:  
     (show modified function or config)

Do NOT apply the changes automatically.

====================================================
STEP 5 — FINAL REPORT
====================================================

Provide a concise, harsh summary:

1. STATUS:
   - "DYNAMIC WARNINGS: SAFE" or
   - "DYNAMIC WARNINGS: SHOULD FIX"

2. For each warning:
   - Short label (e.g. “Warning #1: dynamic route without generateStaticParams”)
   - Impact (blocking / risky / harmless)
   - Recommended action (fix now / fix later / ignore)

3. GLOBAL RECOMMENDATION:
   - If everything is non-critical and safe:
     - Say: “From a production readiness standpoint, these warnings do NOT block launch and are minor improvements only.”
   - If any warning is truly risky:
     - Say: “Fix these N warnings before scaling traffic.”
