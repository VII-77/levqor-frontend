You are the Replit AI Agent working on the production frontend for Levqor:

  Project path:  ~/workspace/levqor-site
  Tech:          Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, NextAuth, Vercel
  Domain:        https://levqor.ai  (project “levqor-site” in Vercel)

GOAL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. Implement a **proper Genesis v8 landing page**:
   - Strong hero with Levqor brand & logo
   - Coloured tiles/cards for value props
   - Clear sections and hierarchy (not plain white)
2. Polish the **/signin** experience:
   - Clean, branded sign-in page
   - Visible options: “Sign in with Google” and “Get magic link”
   - DO NOT break existing NextAuth/auth config
3. Verify with real commands (lint + build), then **git commit + push** to `main` so Vercel deploys.
4. Prove deployment with real checks (HTML grep, curl, etc.).

HARD RULES
- Do NOT change environment variables, secrets, or backend auth adapters.
- Do NOT add heavy backend dependencies (no Prisma, no DB migrations, no new adapters).
- Auth logic (NextAuth config, callbacks, providers) should remain intact unless you see a clearly wrong import/version mismatch that prevents build.
- Keep changes focused on:
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (homepage)
  - `src/app/signin/page.*` or equivalent sign-in route
  - Any minimal styling files needed (e.g., `globals.css` or a tokens CSS file)
- Every time you “think something should work”, VERIFY it:
  - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`
  - Use `curl` + `grep` to confirm deployed HTML on levqor.ai

──────────────────────────────── PHASE 0 – SANITY CHECK

1. Confirm project and structure:
   - Run:
     - `pwd`
     - `ls`
     - `ls src`
     - `ls src/app`
   - Ensure we are in `~/workspace/levqor-site` and Next.js App Router is active (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx` exists).

2. Detect styling system:
   - Run:
     - `ls src/app | grep -E "globals\\.css|global\\.css" || echo "no globals"`
     - `ls | grep tailwind || ls src | grep tailwind || echo "no tailwind file"`
   - If Tailwind is configured (tailwind.config.* present and used), use Tailwind classes.
   - If not, extend existing CSS approach (global or CSS modules).

3. Locate sign-in route:
   - Run:
     - `find src/app -maxdepth 3 -type f | grep -E "signin|sign-in|auth" || echo "no explicit signin page"`
   - Identify the file that renders the sign-in form (e.g., `src/app/signin/page.tsx`).

Show a short summary (in the log) of:
- Styling approach (Tailwind vs plain CSS).
- Homepage file path.
- Sign-in page path.

──────────────────────────────── PHASE 1 – AUDIT CURRENT HOMEPAGE

1. Print the current homepage:
   - `sed -n '1,220p' src/app/page.tsx`
2. Briefly assess:
   - Is it mostly plain white with little structure?
   - Does it lack coloured tiles/cards and a strong hero?

Do NOT change anything yet—just inspect and understand.

──────────────────────────────── PHASE 2 – IMPLEMENT GENESIS v8 HOMEPAGE

You will now REPLACE the current homepage content with a more polished Genesis v8 landing layout.

REQUIREMENTS:

A. Layout + structure
- Use `<main>` as root in `page.tsx`.
- Top-level sections:
  1) Header/nav
  2) Hero
  3) “Why teams choose Levqor” tiles
  4) Social proof / logos strip
  5) Features section
  6) CTA footer

B. Header / Nav
- Left: simple Levqor logo area:
  - Either text “Levqor” with a small accent (and maybe a tiny SVG mark), or reuse any existing logo component if present.
- Right: links:
  - “Pricing” → `/pricing`
  - “Docs”    → `/docs` (or whatever route exists; if none, link to `#features` anchor)
  - “Contact” → `/contact` (or `mailto:founders@levqor.ai` if no route)
  - “Sign in” button → `/signin`
- Use a light border or subtle background to visually separate the header.

C. Hero section
- Large headline: `Automate work. Ship faster.`
- Subheading emphasizing self-healing automation, e.g.:
  `Self-healing workflows that monitor failures, auto-recover, and keep your operations running while you sleep.`
- Two primary CTAs (buttons):
  - Primary: “Start free trial” → `/signin` or `/signup` (use `/signin` if no signup route).
  - Secondary: “See pricing” → `/pricing`.
- Auth callouts:
  - “Sign in with Google” button that routes to `/signin` (no auth logic change, just link).
  - “Get magic link” button that routes to `/signin?method=magic-link` (UI only).
- Visual:
  - On desktop: text on left, a simple “dashboard preview” card stack on right.
  - On mobile: stack vertically.
  - Use brand-like colours (e.g. deep slate/indigo background for hero, bright accent on the primary button) using Tailwind or existing CSS.

D. “Why teams choose Levqor” coloured tiles
Add a section with a responsive card grid (tiles). At least 4 tiles; for example:

- Tile 1 – “Self-healing runs”
  - Text: “Automatic retries and fallbacks so you don’t babysit workflows.”
- Tile 2 – “Visual builder”
  - Text: “Design automations like Lego – no wall of YAML.”
- Tile 3 – “Signals, not noise”
  - Text: “Alerting that highlights real incidents, not every log line.”
- Tile 4 – “Compliance-ready”
  - Text: “Audit trails and access control ready for your governance team.”

Styling:
- Each tile should:
  - Have a coloured background (soft blues, purples, greens).
  - Use rounded corners and a subtle shadow.
  - Have icons or simple badges if easy (optional).
  - Be in a responsive grid (1 column mobile, 2 tablet, up to 4 on desktop).

E. Social proof / logos strip
- A section under the tiles:
  - Heading: `Trusted by teams that can’t afford downtime`
  - Row of placeholder logos (e.g., “Acme”, “Northwind”, etc.) or small neutral shapes, styled to look like muted brand strips.

F. Features section
- Two-column layout:
  - Left:
    - Heading: `Built for self-healing automation`
    - Short paragraph.
    - Bullet list, e.g.:
      - “Runbooks with guardrails and approvals”
      - “Multi-step workflows with retries and fallbacks”
      - “End-to-end tracing from trigger to outcome”
  - Right:
    - A styled code block or pseudo-flow diagram (boxes with arrows) representing a workflow pipeline.
- Ensure good spacing and visual hierarchy (bigger font sizes for headings, etc.).

G. CTA footer
- Final section at bottom:
  - Heading: `Ready to automate the boring parts?`
  - Supporting text: “Start in minutes. No long-term contracts.”
  - Button: “Get started with Levqor” → `/signin` (or `/signup` if you have one).
- Simple, centered, visually distinct from previous sections.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Edit `src/app/page.tsx`:
   - Preserve the default export signature required by the Next.js App Router.
   - Use the existing layout wrapper if there is a shared Layout in `layout.tsx`.
   - Implement the structure above. If Tailwind is available, use Tailwind classes for layout, spacing, colours, and responsiveness. If not, define CSS classes and hook them via existing CSS.

2. If you need extra styling:
   - If Tailwind: only use utilities; do NOT modify tailwind.config unless required and safe.
   - If global CSS:
     - Extend `src/app/globals.css` or the equivalent with high-level classes like:
       - `.hero`, `.heroTitle`, `.tilesGrid`, `.tile`, `.ctaButtonPrimary`, `.ctaButtonSecondary`, etc.
   - Keep CSS minimal and focused on homepage layout.

Show the full new content of:
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- Any CSS file you changed.

──────────────────────────────── PHASE 3 – POLISH /SIGNIN PAGE (UI ONLY)

1. Locate the sign-in page (from Phase 0), for example:
   - `src/app/signin/page.tsx` or similar.

2. Inspect:
   - Print first ~200 lines of the file.
   - See how it currently renders (plain form? default NextAuth?).

3. Upgrade the layout for /signin WITHOUT changing backend logic:
   - Wrap the existing sign-in components in a card-like layout with:
     - Levqor logo and title at top.
     - Short text: “Sign in to Levqor”.
   - Ensure:
     - There is a clear “Sign in with Google” button that uses the existing NextAuth handler (if it already exists in the code, just style it nicely).
     - A “Get magic link” option:
       - If email provider is already wired in NextAuth AND the adapter is present:
         - Show a simple email input + submit button that posts to the existing email sign-in route.
       - If NOT wired:
         - Show a non-breaking stub UI: label “Get magic link (coming soon)” with disabled button OR a simple note, but DO NOT attempt to implement new backend logic.
   - Use the same design language as the homepage (colours, typography, etc.).
   - Make sure mobile layout is readable.

4. DO NOT:
   - Add or remove providers in NextAuth config.
   - Introduce a new database adapter.
   - Change callback URLs or secret handling.

After changes, print the updated sign-in page file.

──────────────────────────────── PHASE 4 – LINT & BUILD (MUST PASS)

1. Run:
   - `npm install`   # only if dependencies are missing
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run build`
2. If either command fails:
   - Read the error carefully.
   - Fix the specific TS/JSX/CSS issues you introduced.
   - Re-run until both `npm run lint` and `npm run build` complete successfully with exit code 0.
3. Summarize:
   - Lint status: PASS/FAIL
   - Build status: PASS/FAIL
   - Any relevant warnings (warnings are acceptable if they don’t indicate breakage).

──────────────────────────────── PHASE 5 – GIT COMMIT & PUSH

1. Check current status:
   - `git status`
2. You should see only the files you intentionally changed, e.g.:
   - `src/app/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/signin/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/globals.css` (or similar)
3. Stage, commit, push:
   - `git add src/app/page.tsx`
   - `git add src/app/signin/page.*`      # adjust to actual path
   - `git add src/app/globals.css`        # or any additional CSS file you modified
   - `git commit -m "feat(ui): Genesis v8 homepage + polished sign-in layout"`
   - `git push origin main`
4. Show `git status` after push (should be “working tree clean”).

──────────────────────────────── PHASE 6 – POST-DEPLOY VERIFICATION (LEVQOR.AI)

Assume Vercel auto-deploys on push to `main`.

1. Wait ~60–90 seconds for Vercel deployment to complete.

2. Verify that https://levqor.ai serves the new UI:
   - Run:
     - `curl -sSI https://levqor.ai | grep -E "HTTP/2|x-vercel-id|age:|x-vercel-cache"`
   - Expect:
     - `HTTP/2 200`
     - `x-vercel-cache: MISS` or `DYNAMIC`
     - `age: 0` or a very low value

3. Verify the new HTML content is live:
   - Run:
     - `curl -s https://levqor.ai | grep -E "Automate work\. Ship faster\.|Why teams choose Levqor|Self-healing runs|Visual builder|Get magic link" | head -10`
   - You MUST see multiple of these strings in the HTML. If not, investigate:
     - Check which deployment is attached to `levqor.ai`.
     - Confirm that `main` branch matches your latest commit.

4. Verify `/signin` layout:
   - Run:
     - `curl -s https://levqor.ai/signin | grep -E "Sign in to Levqor|Sign in with Google|Get magic link" | head -10`
   - Confirm the page contains those strings (indicating the new layout is served).

If any of these checks fail (wrong status code, missing strings, or old HTML), debug and fix before considering this task complete.
