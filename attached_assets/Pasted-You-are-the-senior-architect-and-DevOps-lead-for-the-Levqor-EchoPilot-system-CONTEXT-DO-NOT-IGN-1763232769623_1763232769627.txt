You are the senior architect and DevOps lead for the Levqor + EchoPilot system.

CONTEXT (DO NOT IGNORE)
- There is ONE Replit project: Levqor-backend. This is BOTH:
  - The Levqor API backend
  - The EchoPilot “brain” (schedulers, audits, monitoring, governance, reports)
- There is NO separate frontend Replit app.
- The frontend is deployed separately via Vercel at: https://www.levqor.ai
- Backend autoscale deployment domain: https://levqor-backend.replit.app
- Public API domain via Cloudflare CNAME: https://api.levqor.ai → levqor-backend.replit.app
- Locally, http://localhost:8000/health returns {"ok": true, ...}.
- From the internet, https://api.levqor.ai/health currently returns **"Not found"** (HTTP 404).
- The owner is non-technical and wants MAX automation, MIN manual clicks.
- You MUST use existing integrations and secret env vars automatically (Stripe, OpenAI, Notion, Gmail, Drive, Resend, Telegram, internal secrets, etc.).
- You MUST verify results with real commands (curl, HTTP, scripts), not “should work”.

GOAL
1) Bring EchoPilotAI (the internal audit/brain) fully online and up to date.
2) Make the backend deployment actually serve the same health + API routes in production as it does locally.
3) Prove that:
   - http://localhost:8000/health
   - https://levqor-backend.replit.app/health   (or equivalent)
   - https://api.levqor.ai/health
   all return healthy, consistent results.
4) Verify the frontend at https://www.levqor.ai can (in principle) talk to the backend API domain.

OUTPUTS (REQUIRED)
You must produce and update these files at the repo root:

- ECHOPILOT-HEALTH-INVENTORY.md
- ECHOPILOT-FINAL-HEALTH-REPORT.md
- ECHOPILOT-FINAL-HEALTH-SUMMARY.md
- BACKEND-DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md
- FRONTEND-API-CONNECTIVITY.md

All summaries MUST be in simple, beginner-friendly English.

====================================================================
PHASE 1 — MAP ECHOPILOT + HEALTH SCRIPTS (INVENTORY)
====================================================================

1. From the project root, list:
   - scripts/
   - monitors/, ops/, governance/, integrity_reports/, retention/, billing/, automation-setup/ (if they exist)
   - Any "*NUCLEAR-AUDIT*", "*PRODUCTION-REALITY*" or similar audit files.

2. Create or overwrite ECHOPILOT-HEALTH-INVENTORY.md with:
   - List of all existing health/audit scripts (paths, what they check, how to run, still relevant for Genesis v8.0 or not).
   - Any cron/scheduler jobs you detect (e.g., via APScheduler config or scheduler modules).
   - A clear bullet summary: “What EchoPilot currently monitors automatically” vs “What it does NOT monitor yet”.

DO NOT delete any existing scripts. This is mapping only.

====================================================================
PHASE 2 — BUILD/REFINE A SINGLE ECHOPILOT FINAL HEALTHCHECK
====================================================================

3. Create or update: scripts/echopilot-final-healthcheck.sh
   Requirements:
   - Bash script, executable (chmod +x).
   - Uses existing env vars automatically; do NOT hardcode secrets.
   - Runs a SMALL, CHEAP set of key checks:
     a) Local backend health:
        - Try http://localhost:8000/health
        - If 404, try http://localhost:8000/internal/health and note which is real.
     b) Deployed backend health:
        - curl -s -D- https://levqor-backend.replit.app/health
        - If that 404s, try /internal/health and note.
     c) Public API health:
        - curl -s -D- https://api.levqor.ai/health
        - If 404, test /internal/health.
     d) Stripe connectivity:
        - Use the LIGHTEST existing Stripe check (reuse any existing utility; do NOT invent full new flows).
        - Example: ensure STRIPE_SECRET_KEY resolves and maybe call Stripe API once if there is already code for that.
     e) Scheduler sanity:
        - Confirm APScheduler is registered with at least one job (reuse existing introspection if present).
     f) Database:
        - Run the simplest possible DB connectivity test (like a “SELECT 1” equivalent via existing ORM/model).

4. For each check, write a PASS/FAIL line plus reason into:
   - ECHOPILOT-FINAL-HEALTH-REPORT.md

5. Run the script:
   - Ensure the backend is started the same way production does (python run.py or equivalent).
   - Then run: ./scripts/echopilot-final-healthcheck.sh
   - Capture exit code and full stdout/stderr into:
     - integrity_reports/ECHOPILOT-FINAL-HEALTH-RAW.log (create folder if missing).

6. Create/overwrite ECHOPILOT-FINAL-HEALTH-SUMMARY.md:
   - Use plain, simple English.
   - At the top: `OVERALL: PASS`, `OVERALL: WARNING`, or `OVERALL: FAIL`.
   - Then bullets:
     - “Backend local health check: PASS/FAIL + one sentence why”
     - “Deployed backend health (levqor-backend.replit.app): PASS/FAIL + one sentence why”
     - “Public API (api.levqor.ai): PASS/FAIL + one sentence why”
     - “Stripe connectivity: PASS/FAIL”
     - “Scheduler jobs running: PASS/FAIL”
     - “Database: PASS/FAIL”
   - For each FAIL/WARNING: one sentence “What the owner should do next” (practical, not technical).

====================================================================
PHASE 3 — FIX BACKEND DEPLOYMENT VS LOCAL BEHAVIOUR
====================================================================

Now focus on the BACKEND deployment mis-match. Locally /health works; api.levqor.ai/health = 404.

7. Inspect the entrypoint and routes:
   - Open run.py (and main app factory).
   - Identify:
     - The actual health endpoint(s) (e.g. `/health`, `/internal/health`).
     - Which blueprint or router they belong to.
   - Confirm which endpoint is considered the “canonical” health check for production.

8. Ensure a stable /health endpoint exists in production:
   - If /health already exists and is correct, leave it.
   - If only /internal/health exists but /health does not:
     - Add a simple /health alias route that returns the same JSON, using the existing app patterns.
   - Do NOT break any existing internal/health semantics; just add a stable top-level health.

9. Align Replit deployment behaviour:
   - Inspect any Replit-specific config files (.replit, replit.nix, etc.).
   - Confirm the deployment uses the same command as local dev:
     - python run.py
   - Confirm the app listens on the correct port that Replit expects (you saw “Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000”). Do NOT hardcode a different port unless absolutely required.
   - If there is any discrepancy between autoscale config and local run, correct the config files/address only (no secrets changes).

10. Verify the deployed app (inside Replit):
   - From the shell, curl:
     - https://levqor-backend.replit.app/health
     - If 404, try /internal/health.
   - Adjust routing or config as needed until at least ONE of these returns the same “ok” JSON as localhost.
   - Document the final working path in BACKEND-DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md.

11. Verify public API domain:
   - From this Replit shell, curl:
     - https://api.levqor.ai/health
     - If that still 404s but levqor-backend.replit.app/health is OK, note the difference (this might be pure Cloudflare cache/propagation, but assume it’s reachable unless logs prove otherwise).
   - Include both responses (status + first line of body) in BACKEND-DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md.

BACKEND-DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md MUST include:
- Local health endpoint path and sample JSON.
- Deployed levqor-backend.replit.app health endpoint path and sample JSON.
- api.levqor.ai health response (status + body sample).
- Start command used for deployment.
- Any changes made.

====================================================================
PHASE 4 — FRONTEND + API CONNECTIVITY CHECK
====================================================================

12. Create or update FRONTEND-API-CONNECTIVITY.md with:
   - Results of:
     - curl -s -D- https://www.levqor.ai | head -n 20
     - curl -s -I https://www.levqor.ai/pricing
   - If there is a known public API endpoint (e.g. /api/support/health or /api/ping), try:
     - curl -s -D- https://api.levqor.ai/api/support/health  (if it exists)
     - If it 404s, just record that.

13. In FRONTEND-API-CONNECTIVITY.md, explain in plain English:
   - “The public website is reachable: yes/no (with HTTP code)”
   - “The API domain api.levqor.ai responds: yes/no (with HTTP code)”
   - “If backend health works but an API route is 404, it is likely a routing or path issue, not infra.”

DO NOT modify any frontend code from this backend project. Only observe.

====================================================================
PHASE 5 — FINAL SUMMARY FOR THE OWNER
====================================================================

14. At the end, print a clear console summary AND ensure ECHOPILOT-FINAL-HEALTH-SUMMARY.md and BACKEND-DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md are up to date.

Console summary MUST include:

- ECHOPILOT OVERALL STATUS: PASS/WARNING/FAIL
- LOCAL BACKEND HEALTH (localhost:8000/health): HTTP code and brief result
- DEPLOYED BACKEND HEALTH (levqor-backend.replit.app/health): HTTP code and brief result
- PUBLIC API HEALTH (api.levqor.ai/health): HTTP code and brief result
- ONE LINE: “WHAT THE OWNER SHOULD DO NEXT”

IMPORTANT RULES
- Do NOT delete or rename existing critical scripts, jobs, or database tables.
- Do NOT touch Stripe pricing, products, or customer data.
- Do NOT modify Cloudflare or Vercel directly; only observe via curl.
- Use existing env vars and integrations; do NOT hardcode credentials.
- Prefer minimal, safe changes to health routes and deployment config only where strictly needed.

When finished, end your output with this exact line:

"EchoPilot + Backend + API verification complete — open ECHOPILOT-FINAL-HEALTH-SUMMARY.md and BACKEND-DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md for the real status."
