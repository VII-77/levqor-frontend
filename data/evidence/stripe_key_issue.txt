STRIPE_SECRET_KEY CONFIGURATION ISSUE
=====================================

Current Value:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=https://Echopilotai.replit.app/webhook/stripe

Problem:
This is a webhook URL, not a Stripe API key.

Expected Format:
- Test Mode: sk_test_51ABC...xyz (starts with sk_test_)
- Live Mode: sk_live_51ABC...xyz (starts with sk_live_)

How to Get Your Stripe API Key:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Click "Reveal test key" or "Reveal live key"
3. Copy the secret key (starts with sk_test_ or sk_live_)
4. Set it in Replit Secrets as STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

Note: The webhook URL you currently have should be set as:
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (for webhook signature verification)
Not as STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (for API authentication)
