# 1. INTEGRITY + FINALIZER PACK (2-week deliverable)
# Why: Enterprise-grade trust layer, immediate paid feature.

mkdir modules/integrity_pack
touch modules/integrity_pack/{__init__.py,integrity_test.py,finalizer.py,evidence_export.py}

# integrity_test.py
- Run E2E verification of workflows, DB writes, external API calls.
- Produce JSON summary.
# finalizer.py
- Validate schema integrity, environment secrets, webhook endpoints.
# evidence_export.py
- Convert summary to PDF via reportlab.
- Upload to Google Drive → share link.
# Stripe SKU
- Create “Integrity Pack” → one-time or add-on.
# Notion Integration
- Store test results + Drive link in “Integrity Reports” database.

Expected Outcome: new sellable feature, visible audit trail.

# 2. TEMPLATE PACKS + DEMO LIBRARY (3-week deliverable)
# Why: Fast-launch content monetization, boosts conversion.

mkdir modules/template_packs
touch modules/template_packs/{starter.yaml,automation.yaml,demo.yaml}

Each pack:
- Metadata: name, description, price, tags, import_url.
- Files stored in /packs and registered in Notion “Template Library”.
Add purchase flow:
- Stripe Checkout → on success, deliver import_url email via Gmail API.

Expected Outcome: pre-built blueprints sold or given free as growth lever.

# 3. USAGE-BASED API TIER (Weeks 3-5)
# Why: Monetize developers and heavy users.

Implement metering middleware:
- Count each API call by user_id.
- Write usage to Redis or DB.
- Sync totals nightly → Stripe usage records.
Expose endpoints:
  GET /api/usage → remaining credits
  POST /api/billing → purchase credits
Add plan: “Developer Pay-As-You-Go” with $ per 1000 calls.

Expected Outcome: scalable incremental revenue with minimal support.

---

# 4. WHITE-LABEL EDITION + MANAGED PILOT (Weeks 5-8)
# Why: Agency channel and enterprise demand.

mkdir modules/white_label
touch modules/white_label/{branding.py,tenant_config.json,api_overrides.py}

branding.py → dynamic logo/colors per tenant  
tenant_config.json → keys, billing, domains  
api_overrides.py → allow custom endpoints  

Run Managed Service Pilot:
- Choose 1–2 design partners.
- Operate Levqor for them using same backend.
- Gather ROI data → publish case study.

Expected Outcome: new B2B revenue stream, proofs for sales.
