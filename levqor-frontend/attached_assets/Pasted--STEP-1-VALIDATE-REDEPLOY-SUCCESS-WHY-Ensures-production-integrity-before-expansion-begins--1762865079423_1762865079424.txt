### STEP 1 — VALIDATE REDEPLOY SUCCESS
# WHY: Ensures production integrity before expansion begins.
# IMPACT IF IGNORED: Corrupt baseline or unstable build will break new modules.

1. Visit https://levqor.ai and confirm:
   - [x] Homepage loads < 2s, no console errors.
   - [x] Stripe Checkout opens + completes test transaction.
   - [x] Health ping endpoint returns 200 (status page clean).
   - [x] Analytics + SEO tags (meta, OpenGraph, sitemap.xml, robots.txt) verified.
   - [x] Security headers pass (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy).

2. Record results in `/docs/validation-log.md` inside Notion’s “Launch Validation” database.

### STEP 2 — ACTIVATE AFTER-LAUNCH AUTOMATION
# WHY: Initializes auto-monitoring, cost control, and content tracking.
# BENEFIT: Keeps system self-auditing; reduces manual workload.
# IMPACT IF IGNORED: Cost creep and missed uptime issues.

- Enable daily **Health Check automation** (status, uptime, Replit spend ≤ $10/day).  
- Start **Cost Dashboard sync** from Replit + Stripe + Vercel.  
- Initialize **Sentry + uptime monitor**.  
- Turn on **After-Launch Notion automation** → sends weekly pulse summary.

### STEP 3 — TRANSITION TO v5.0 STABILIZATION
# WHY: Locks launch scope, shifts focus to scaling readiness.
# BENEFIT: Stable foundation for monetization and enterprise builds.
# IMPACT IF IGNORED: Fragmented roadmap and unstable scaling.

- Freeze roadmap; move pending pre-launch tasks to “Completed.”  
- Enable “v5.0 Readiness” group in Notion roadmap.  
- Tasks to activate:
  - [x] Job Log schema audit  
  - [x] Validation hardening script  
  - [x] One-Click Integrity Test (base module active)  
  - [x] Cost alerts confirmed working  
  - [x] Optional Railway fallback test
