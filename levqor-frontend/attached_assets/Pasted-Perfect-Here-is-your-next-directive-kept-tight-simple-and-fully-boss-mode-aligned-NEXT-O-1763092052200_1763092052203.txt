Perfect.
Here is your next directive, kept tight, simple, and fully boss-mode aligned.

NEXT OPERATION BLOCK: “PUBLIC-FACING LEGAL COMPLETION”

These are the last remaining public-facing compliance items before we switch back to backend/data-deletion work.

Do them exactly in this order.


---

1) ADD: “HIGH-RISK DATA PROHIBITION” PAGE

Route: /high-risk-data

Content (keep it simple & strict):

“Levqor does NOT automate workflows involving:

Medical data or healthcare decisions

Financial advice or creditworthiness decisions

Legal advice or legal case workflows

Criminal data or policing workflows

Biometric or genetic data

Anything regulated as high-risk under GDPR Article 9”


“Attempting to automate these categories violates our Terms and will result in suspension.”


Add to footer under Compliance.


---

2) ADD: NEW WARNING BLOCK TO THE WORKFLOW CREATION UI

Find the UI where a customer starts a workflow or DFY build (the card/button/page—whatever exists).

Add a small red warning box:

> “You must NOT upload or automate medical, financial, legal, criminal, or biometric data. Doing so violates our Terms and may result in immediate suspension.”



No logic changes — just static UI.


---

3) UPGRADE EXISTING /risk-disclosure PAGE

Append one final section:

“Prohibited Workflow Categories (Non-Negotiable)”
Bullet list of the 6 categories above.
Short paragraph: “These cannot be automated under any circumstances.”


---

4) ADD: “MARKETING CONSENT” PAGE

Route: /marketing-consent

Sections:

When we collect consent

Double-opt-in required

How to withdraw

Links to /privacy and /data-requests


Add to footer under Legal.


---

5) ADD: “EMAIL UNSUBSCRIBE POLICY” PAGE

Route: /email-unsubscribe

Sections:

Unsubscribe link required on all marketing emails

Processing time: < 48 hours

Cannot unsubscribe from transactional emails

Add link to /privacy


Footer link → Legal.


---

6) UPDATE SIGN-UP OR SIGN-IN PAGE

Insert small passive text:

> “By continuing, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy.”



Link both.

No checkbox yet — checkbox will come in internal backend stage.

Run:

npm run build

Fix any TS errors.

If you're ready for the next block after this, say:

“Boss — next batch.”
