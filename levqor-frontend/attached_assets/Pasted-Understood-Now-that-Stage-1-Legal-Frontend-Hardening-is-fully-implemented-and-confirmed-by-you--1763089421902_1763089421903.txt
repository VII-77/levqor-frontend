Understood.
Now that Stage 1 (Legal Frontend Hardening) is fully implemented and confirmed by you:

Here is your next step, in simple English — Stage 1B: Verification + Lock-In
(small, fast, safe, zero-deploy)


---

✅ Stage 1B — Final Lock-In Tasks (15 minutes total)

These steps make sure everything we just added works, survives restarts, and is ready for Stage 2.

1. Screenshot verification (3 screenshots)

Open your browser (local preview in Replit):

Take 3 screenshots:

1. Homepage
Showing: Cookie banner + High-Risk warning


2. Sign-In page
Showing:

Terms checkbox

Marketing checkbox

Disabled sign-in buttons before accept



3. Pricing page
Showing:

High-risk warning

DFY + Subscription pricing




Send the screenshots here.
(This confirms UI is actually visible — the biggest GDPR requirement.)


---

2. Confirm consent cookie exists

In Chrome dev tools → Application → Cookies → your local hostname:

You should see:

levqor_cookie_consent

Contains JSON with analytics/marketing fields


Tell me “cookie exists” once confirmed.


---

3. Confirm the console logs appear

In your Replit console, after interacting with the sign-in page:

You should see:

{ type: "tos_accept", ... }

And if marketing is ticked:

{ type: "marketing_double_opt_in_stub", ... }

Tell me “logs appear”.


---

4. Confirm the new pages load

Open each of the following (local preview or 5000 port):

/unsubscribe

/risk-disclosure

/ai-disclosure

/support-policy

/acceptable-use

/fair-use

/account-suspension


Tell me “pages load”.


---

📌 Once ALL 4 confirmations are done…

I will deliver:

Stage 2 — DSAR System (Full GDPR Export Flow)

This includes:

Export my data (UI)

Email export link (stub)

JSON/CSV generation

Logging + audit

30-day deletion tracking

User identity verification check

Secure download flow

Internal compliance logs


It will be delivered as one compressed, safe, fully executable Replit prompt.

Your turn

Reply with:

1. Screenshots


2. “cookie exists”


3. “logs appear”


4. “pages load”



When all 4 are done, I activate Stage 2.
