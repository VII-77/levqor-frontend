You are Replit AI Agent working on the Levqor project.

GOAL: Implement OPERATIONS BLOCK: public status page, SLA credit request, dispute resolution, and emergency contact runbook — all wired into the existing Next.js app without touching pricing, checkout, or auth.


---

0. CONTEXT

Frontend: levqor-site (Next.js App Router, Genesis v8 dark theme, Tailwind v3).

Backend: separate; do not modify.

Existing legal/policy pages already live (terms, privacy, fair-use, sla, incident-response, etc.).

You must:

Add 4 new pages and link them in footer.

Keep everything consistent with current design.

Avoid breaking routes or Typescript.



Work in:
cd ~/workspace/levqor-site


---

1) STATUS PAGE /status

1. Find existing layout/footer components to re-use:

Search: src/app/layout.tsx, src/components/Footer.tsx, src/components/*Nav*.



2. Create page: src/app/status/page.tsx

Server component.

Dark theme, use same outer shell as existing pages (max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-10 etc.).

Sections:

Status header:

Title: “System status”

Sub: “Live view of Levqor uptime and incidents.”


Current status card:

Show static “Operational” badge for now.

Text: “All core services are running normally.”

Placeholder field for “Last updated: generated at build time”.


Service list (static for now):

“Dashboard & UI (levqor.ai)” → Operational.

“API & workflows (api.levqor.ai)” → Operational.

“Background jobs & schedulers” → Operational.

Use colored pills (green for operational).


Incident history stub:

Short list of 3 example incidents (all “Resolved”), with date, duration, impact summary.

Make clear this is example/historical, not live.



Do not call any external APIs; static content only.



3. Ensure page exports default React component and no TS errors.




---

2) SLA CREDITS REQUEST PAGE /sla-credits

1. Create: src/app/sla-credits/page.tsx


2. Content:

Title: “SLA credits & downtime claims”.

Short explainer that credits are available according to /sla.

Add bullet list:

Who can request (account owner, billing contact).

Time window to submit (e.g., within 30 days of incident).

Proof needed (timestamps, logs, screenshots).


Add form UI (client component section):

Fields:

Full name

Work email

Account / company name

Plan (Starter / Growth / Pro / Business)

Incident date/time (text input for now)

Description (textarea)


Under the hood:

Do not wire to real backend.

On submit, prevent default and show success toast/text:

“We’ve received your SLA credit request. We’ll review within 5–7 business days.”



For now, just log to console (console.log("SLA request", formData)).






---

3) DISPUTE RESOLUTION PAGE /disputes

1. Create: src/app/disputes/page.tsx


2. Content:

Title: “Dispute resolution & complaints”.

Clear, calm wording; align with /terms and /refunds.

Sections:

Step 1 – Contact support first

Email support@levqor.ai (static text).

Response SLA (e.g., 1–3 business days).


Step 2 – Escalation

When a ticket is escalated.

Mention /support-escalation if it exists, or include a brief summary inline.


Step 3 – Formal complaint

For unresolved matters, users can:

Email a dedicated address like complaints@levqor.ai (static).

Include account details, timeline, screenshots.



Step 4 – External avenues

Short note: for UK/EU users, refer to relevant regulators if unresolved (without naming specific bodies).



Include short note:

“Chargebacks should be a last resort. We’re happy to work with you on a fair resolution first.”






---

4) EMERGENCY CONTACTS PAGE /emergency-contacts

1. Create: src/app/emergency-contacts/page.tsx


2. Content:

Title: “Emergency contacts & incident procedures”.

Explain this is for Severity 1 issues only (full outage, major data incident, etc.).

Sections:

When to use emergency contacts

List 3–4 examples (complete outage, data breach suspicion, major billing incident).


Contact channels (static placeholders):

Primary: support@levqor.ai

Emergency tag in subject line: “[SEV1] …”

Optional: “In future, a dedicated emergency hotline may be provided to enterprise customers.”


What to include

Account, impact, timestamps, any logs or screenshots.


What happens next

Acknowledgment within 1 hour.

Status updates until resolution.



Make clear this is not for routine support requests.





---

5) FOOTER / NAV LINKS

1. Locate footer component (likely src/components/Footer.tsx).


2. Add new links in a sensible section (e.g., “Status & policies”):

Status → /status

SLA credits → /sla-credits

Disputes → /disputes

Emergency contacts → /emergency-contacts



3. Keep styling consistent with existing links (same Tailwind classes).




---

6) SANITY CHECKS

From levqor-site root:

1. Type check / build:

npm run build

Fix any TS/ESLint errors from the new files.



2. Dev sanity (if used in this environment):

npm run dev (or ensure existing dev workflow still starts cleanly).



3. Verify routes respond (if curl to localhost:5000 is wired in this env):

/status

/sla-credits

/disputes

/emergency-contacts





---

7) WHAT TO REPORT BACK

When done, provide a short summary (no essays):

Confirm files created/edited (paths).

Confirm npm run build passes.

Confirm all 4 routes load without errors in the dev environment.
