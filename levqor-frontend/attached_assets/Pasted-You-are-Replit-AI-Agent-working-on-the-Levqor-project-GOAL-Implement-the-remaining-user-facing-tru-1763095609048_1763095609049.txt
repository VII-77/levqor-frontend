You are Replit AI Agent working on the Levqor project.

GOAL
Implement the remaining user-facing trust/compliance UX pieces for Levqor WITHOUT deploying to Vercel:

1) DFY “Master Contract” page (single, clear, client-friendly contract)
2) Public Status page
3) Service Credits / SLA claim flow
4) Dispute Resolution page + simple workflow
5) Explicit high-risk data warnings wired into real UI screens
6) Basic API docs page (even if the API is not fully public yet)

CONSTRAINTS
- Repo:
  - Frontend: `levqor-site` (Next.js 14 App Router)
  - Backend: Flask API at repo root
- Do NOT:
  - Change Stripe prices/plans or checkout logic.
  - Deploy to Vercel.
- DO:
  - Reuse existing legal pages and policies (Terms, SLA, Fair Use, Risk Disclosure, etc.).
  - Keep copy consistent with existing language (UK, GDPR, DFY + subscriptions).
  - Verify everything with `npm run build` and curl where relevant.

────────────────────────
STEP 0 — QUICK DISCOVERY (READ-ONLY)
────────────────────────

1. FRONTEND:
   - List existing legal/policy pages under `levqor-site/src/app`:
     - Especially: `terms`, `sla`, `refunds`, `fair-use`, `acceptable-use`, `risk-disclosure`, `onboarding`, `delivery`, `revisions`, `offboarding`, `support-policy`.
   - Find:
     - Layout components (header/footer) used for global nav.
     - Where we link to legal pages in footer and sign-in page.

2. BACKEND:
   - Check for any existing:
     - `/api/status` or similar health endpoints.
     - Models/endpoints for SLA credits, disputes, or support tickets.
   - Do NOT modify anything yet; just understand what’s there.

Keep notes internally; only print final summaries and code diffs.

────────────────────────
STEP 1 — DFY MASTER CONTRACT PAGE
────────────────────────

GOAL
Single, human-readable but serious DFY contract page that consolidates:
- Scope, deliverables, and responsibilities
- Timelines and revision rules
- Out-of-scope work
- Liability, disclaimers, and termination
- Links back to Terms, SLA, Fair Use, Refunds

A) NEW PAGE

1. Add: `levqor-site/src/app/dfy-contract/page.tsx`
   - Content structure (suggested):
     - H1: “Managed Automation (Done-For-You) Agreement”
     - Sections:
       - 1) Scope of Services
         - Reference DFY tiers (Starter, Professional, Enterprise).
         - Use existing copy from `/delivery`, `/revisions`, `/onboarding`.
       - 2) Client Responsibilities
         - Access, credentials, timely responses, testing.
       - 3) Deliverables & Timelines
         - Pull from `/delivery` (48h/3–4 days/7 days).
       - 4) Revisions & Changes
         - Pull from `/revisions` (revision counts, out-of-scope work).
       - 5) Limitations & Exclusions
         - MUST mention that high-risk domains (medical/legal/financial etc.) are restricted and must follow `/risk-disclosure` & `/acceptable-use`.
       - 6) Payment, Refunds, and Cancellation
         - Refer to `/billing`, `/refunds`, `/cancellation`.
       - 7) Liability & Disclaimers
         - Link to `/terms` §§ for limitation of liability and warranties.
       - 8) Data & Confidentiality
         - Refer to `/privacy` and `/dpa`.
       - 9) Governing Law & Disputes
         - Link to `/terms` dispute clause and the Dispute page you’ll create in Step 3.

   - Use a similar layout to other legal pages, with a table-of-contents at top.

B) NAVIGATION

1. Add link in footer:
   - E.g. under “Legal & Policies” section: “DFY Agreement” → `/dfy-contract`.

────────────────────────
STEP 2 — PUBLIC STATUS PAGE
────────────────────────

GOAL
Simple `/status` page that shows current system status (manual for now, can be wired later).

A) BACKEND (OPTIONAL, LIGHTWEIGHT)

1. If there is already a health endpoint (e.g. `/api/status/health`), reuse it.
2. If not:
   - Add a minimal Flask endpoint:
     - `GET /api/status/health`
     - Returns JSON: `{ "ok": true, "api": "healthy" }`
   - This is NOT a full status platform, just a basic health check.

B) FRONTEND: `/status` PAGE

1. Add: `levqor-site/src/app/status/page.tsx`
   - Client page that:
     - Calls the health endpoint (if available).
     - Shows:
       - Overall status: “Operational” / “Degraded” / “Major outage” (hard-coded as “Operational” for now unless API says otherwise).
       - Sections:
         - API (Levqor backend)
         - Frontend (Levqor app)
         - Third-party services (Stripe, OpenAI, Vercel, Google, Microsoft).
       - Link to:
         - Incident response page (`/incident-response`)
         - Business continuity (`/business-continuity`)
   - For now, you can:
     - Treat the API response as a simple boolean.
     - Show timestamp “Last checked: [client time]”.

2. Footer:
   - Add “Status” link to `/status`.

────────────────────────
STEP 3 — SERVICE CREDITS / SLA CLAIM FLOW
────────────────────────

GOAL
Give customers a clear way to request SLA credits when uptime/response targets are missed.

A) BACKEND: SIMPLE ENDPOINT

1. Add a minimal model or reuse an existing “support ticket”/“contact” model if present. If none exists:
   - `SlaCreditRequest` model:
     - `id`, `user_id` (nullable if not logged in), `email`, `plan`, `incident_date`, `description`, `status` (`"open"|"reviewing"|"approved"|"rejected"`), timestamps.

2. Endpoint:
   - `POST /api/sla/credits/request`
     - Accepts JSON:
       - `email`, `plan`, `incidentDate`, `description`.
     - Creates record with `status="open"`.
     - Returns `{ ok: true }`.
   - `GET /api/sla/credits/my` (auth optional):
     - If logged in, return user’s own requests.
     - If not, this can be skipped or later implemented; not critical.

B) FRONTEND: `/sla-credits` PAGE

1. Add: `levqor-site/src/app/sla-credits/page.tsx`
   - Content:
     - Explain SLA briefly:
       - Link to `/sla`.
       - Explain when credits apply.
     - Form:
       - Fields: email, plan (Starter/Growth/Pro/Business/DFY), date of incident, description.
       - On submit, POST to `/api/sla/credits/request`.
       - Show success message.
     - If user is logged in and we can auto-fill email/plan, do so.

2. Add link:
   - From `/sla` page → “Request SLA credit” → `/sla-credits`.
   - Footer → under “Support” or “Legal”.

────────────────────────
STEP 4 — DISPUTE RESOLUTION PAGE
────────────────────────

GOAL
Clear, simple “Here’s how we resolve problems” page, aligned with Terms.

A) NEW PAGE

1. Add: `levqor-site/src/app/disputes/page.tsx`
   - Content:
     - Overview:
       - “If something goes wrong, here’s how we handle it.”
     - Steps:
       - Step 1: Contact support (link to `/support-policy`).
       - Step 2: Escalation (link to `/support-escalation`).
       - Step 3: Mediation / resolution timelines.
     - For DFY vs subscriptions, mention differences if any.
     - Clarify:
       - We try to resolve directly.
       - Link to governing law and jurisdiction in `/terms`.
     - Add note: This page does NOT override legal Terms but explains them in plain English.

B) LINKS

1. From `/terms`:
   - Add a small note / link in the disputes section: “See also our Dispute Resolution page” → `/disputes`.
2. Footer:
   - Add “Disputes” under Legal/Support.

────────────────────────
STEP 5 — HIGH-RISK DATA WARNINGS IN REAL UI
────────────────────────

GOAL
Move high-risk exclusions from “just policy text” into the product experience.

A) WORKFLOW CREATION / BUILDER

1. Find the main workflow creation or onboarding UI in `levqor-site`:
   - E.g. pages under `/workflow`, `/dashboard`, or wherever users define automations.

2. Add a clearly visible warning component:
   - A small callout box near workflow name/description fields:
     - Text (paraphrase, UK-friendly):
       - “Levqor is not designed for medical, legal, or financial advice, or for decisions that could seriously affect someone’s rights, health, or finances. Please do not automate these workflows here.”
     - Links to `/risk-disclosure` and `/acceptable-use`.

3. For DFY purchase flows:
   - On `/pricing` or DFY-specific section:
     - Add a small disclaimer under DFY tiers echoing the same limitation.

B) OPTIONAL HARD GUARDRAIL (LIGHT)

1. If the workflow creation form has description tags/keywords:
   - Add a light front-end check:
     - If description includes obvious keywords (“medical”, “diagnosis”, “legal advice”, “investment recommendation”, etc.), show a strong warning and ask user to confirm they are not using it for prohibited use.
   - Do NOT block completely at this stage; just warn and log.

────────────────────────
STEP 6 — API DOCS PAGE (BASIC)
────────────────────────

GOAL
Have at least a placeholder `/api-docs` describing what exists, even if it’s not fully public.

A) NEW PAGE

1. Add: `levqor-site/src/app/api-docs/page.tsx`
   - Content:
     - Overview of Levqor API (high-level):
       - Authentication (if any public endpoints exist).
       - Rate limits (refer to `/rate-limits`).
       - Main conceptual resources (workflows, runs, logs) – keep generic if API isn’t fully stable.
     - Explicit note:
       - “This API is currently in private beta. Access is by invitation only.”
     - Link to:
       - `/rate-limits`, `/security`, `/privacy`, `/gdpr`.

2. Footer:
   - Add “API Docs” link under “Developers” or similar section.

────────────────────────
STEP 7 — VERIFY & SUMMARISE
────────────────────────

1. BACKEND:
   - Run tests if they exist.
   - Manually verify with curl:
     - `GET /api/status/health` (if you created/updated it).
     - `POST /api/sla/credits/request` with a dummy payload.

2. FRONTEND:
   - `cd levqor-site && npm run lint && npm run build`.
   - Confirm pages exist locally:
     - `/dfy-contract`
     - `/status`
     - `/sla-credits`
     - `/disputes`
     - `/api-docs`
   - Click:
     - Footer links for all new pages.
     - Links from `/terms`, `/sla`, etc. to new pages.
     - Warning banners in workflow builder and DFY pricing.

3. OUTPUT:
   - Print:
     - List of new/modified files.
     - Short summary of each new page/endpoint.
     - Confirmation that build passed and key routes return 200 in dev.

DO NOT deploy or touch Vercel. Leave code ready for later deployment.
