You are the Replit AI Agent working on the Levqor project.

GOAL
Find exactly what changed in the frontend (levqor-site) AFTER the last known successful Vercel deployment commit `51038fb` ("Remove unused catchall"), and summarize the differences versus the current `main` branch. Do NOT modify any files; this is a read-only diff + summary task.

CONTEXT
- Frontend repo: `levqor-site` (Next.js)
- Last known good deployment: Vercel built commit `51038fb` successfully ~15 hours ago.
- Current deployments are failing on newer commits.
- We want to see: which commits and which files changed since `51038fb`, with special attention to:
  - cookie consent / `useCookieConsent` / `@/lib/cookies`
  - new legal/compliance pages
  - any config changes (tsconfig, next.config, package.json, vercel.json, env usage)

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN
1. Verify git history and confirm `51038fb` exists locally.
2. Show the list of commits between `51038fb` and current HEAD on `main`.
3. Show a readable diff summary (files added/changed/removed).
4. Highlight changes touching cookies/consent, hooks, config, and routing.
5. Output a clear human-readable summary for the user.

STEP 1 — ENTER FRONTEND REPO & CONFIRM COMMIT
1. From workspace root:

   ```bash
   cd levqor-site
   git status
   git log --oneline -n 15

2. Confirm that a commit with SHA starting 51038fb is present.

If it is NOT present, search more:

git log --oneline --grep="Remove unused catchall" -n 5 || git log --oneline | head -40



3. Note the exact full SHA for that commit (e.g. 51038fb1234abcd…).



STEP 2 — LIST COMMITS SINCE LAST GOOD DEPLOY

1. Assuming the good commit is exactly 51038fb (or its full SHA), list all commits after it on main:

git rev-parse 51038fb
git rev-parse HEAD
git log --oneline 51038fb..HEAD


2. This shows the sequence of changes that happened AFTER the successful deployment.

Keep this output for the final report.




STEP 3 — HIGH-LEVEL DIFF SUMMARY

1. Show which files changed between 51038fb and current HEAD:

git diff --stat 51038fb..HEAD


2. Show a more detailed summary (no full patch yet):

git diff --name-status 51038fb..HEAD


3. Pay attention to:

any files under src/hooks/

any files under src/components/cookies/

src/lib/*

src/app/**/page.tsx

package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.mjs, vercel.json




STEP 4 — TARGETED DIFFS FOR RISKY AREAS

1. If these files exist in the diff, show focused patches:

# Cookie consent + hooks
git diff 51038fb..HEAD -- src/hooks/useCookieConsent.ts || true
git diff 51038fb..HEAD -- "src/components/cookies" || true
git diff 51038fb..HEAD -- src/lib/cookies.ts || true

# Routing and pages
git diff 51038fb..HEAD -- "src/app" || true

# Config / build behavior
git diff 51038fb..HEAD -- package.json tsconfig.json next.config.* vercel.* || true


2. If any of those paths don’t exist, let them fail gracefully (|| true) and continue.



STEP 5 — SUMMARIZE FOR THE USER

1. Based on the diffs above, produce a concise human-readable summary that answers:

How many commits since 51038fb, and their short messages.

Which major areas changed (e.g. “Added cookie consent system”, “Added DSAR page”, “Modified footer links”, “Added new pages for X”).

Any new imports/aliases such as @/lib/cookies that did not exist at 51038fb.

Any config changes that could affect builds or routes.



2. Present the summary in this structure:

Commits since last good deploy (51038fb → HEAD)

SHA1 message

SHA2 message

…


Key file changes (grouped by area: cookies/hooks, pages, config)

Likely causes of new build/deploy risk
(e.g. “introduced new hook that imports '@/lib/cookies' but file was missing before we added it”).




IMPORTANT RULES

This is a READ-ONLY investigation: do NOT modify, stage, or commit any files.

Do NOT run formatters or linters that change files.

If anything is unclear, still provide best-effort analysis based purely on the git history and diffs.


When you’re done, print the final summary clearly so the user can see exactly what changed since the last successful deployment.
