**Call Structure (30 min):**

**Phase 1: Intro (2 min)**
```
"Hey [Name], great to meet you! Thanks for choosing Levqor.

This call is super simple—I'm going to ask you questions about your workflow, 
take notes, and then we'll build it exactly how you need it.

Sound good? Let's dive in."
```

**Phase 2: Requirements Gathering (15 min)**
```
Q1: "Walk me through the manual process you're doing now. 
     Start to finish—what happens?"

Q2: "What tools are involved?" 
     [List: Tool 1, Tool 2, Tool 3]

Q3: "What data needs to move where?"
     [Map: Tool A → Field X → Tool B → Field Y]

Q4: "Are there any conditions or rules?" 
     (e.g., only if status = X, only on weekdays)

Q5: "What does success look like? How will you know it's working?"

[Take detailed notes in template doc]
```

**Phase 3: Credentials & Access (8 min)**
```
"Perfect. Now I need access to your tools to build this.

For [Tool 2]: [Specific access instructions]
For [Tool 3]: [Specific access instructions]

I'll send you a secure form to submit these after the call.
