  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe Frequency - Reduce Resource Usage\n**Action:** Increase the health probe checks from hourly to every two hours, while ensuring critical checks (like disk usage monitoring) remain frequent. Additionally, consider implementing a conditional check that reduces the frequency during low usage periods or when no critical events are detected.  \n**Expected Impact:** This will decrease resource consumption, particularly CPU and memory usage, leading to enhanced overall performance of the system during off-peak hours.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost Monitoring Alerts - Proactive Financial Management\n**Action:** Develop and integrate a cost alerting system that triggers notifications (e.g., via Telegram) when costs exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., a 10% increase week-over-week).  \n**Expected Impact:** This proactive approach will help prevent unexpected spikes in operational costs, allowing for timely adjustments in usage or optimization efforts, ultimately leading to significant cost savings.\n\n### Priority 3: Enhance User Dashboard Interactivity - Improve Usability\n**Action:** Introduce interactive features on the \"Health & Costs\" and \"Live Ops Monitor\" dashboard cards, such as customizable views, filters for specific metrics, and the ability to export data in various formats (CSV, JSON).  \n**Expected Impact:** Enhancing the user experience will foster better engagement with the dashboard, allow users to derive insights more readily, and improve decision-making processes based on real-time data.",
