  "plan": "Priority 1: **Implement Caching for API Responses** - By introducing caching mechanisms for responses from the `/api/runtime-costs` and `/api/live-ops` endpoints, we can significantly reduce server load and response times. This optimization can lead to faster user interactions and lower CPU usage, thereby enhancing overall performance.\n\nPriority 2: **Optimize Predictive Alerts Logic** - Refine the predictive alerts system to minimize unnecessary checks. For example, introduce a dynamic threshold that adjusts based on historical data patterns, which could reduce the frequency of checks during low activity periods. This would help decrease operational costs associated with resource usage while maintaining effective monitoring.\n\nPriority 3: **Interactive Dashboard Features** - Enhance the user experience by adding interactive elements to the dashboard, such as customizable views and filters for health and cost metrics. Allowing users to adjust the displayed metrics and time ranges can lead to better insights and a more tailored experience, ultimately increasing user satisfaction and engagement.",
