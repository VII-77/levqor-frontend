  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Data Processing Workflows - Expected Impact: Improved performance and reduced latency in API responses.**  \nImplement asynchronous processing for API endpoints, particularly for tasks like invoice creation and customer experience enhancements. This could significantly reduce response times and allow for more concurrent user interactions without overloading the system.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost Monitoring Alerts - Expected Impact: Proactive cost management and reduction in unexpected expenses.**  \nEnhance the cost analytics system by introducing real-time alerts for unusual cost spikes (e.g., over a set percentage increase compared to the average daily cost). This will empower the team to respond quickly to unexpected charges and optimize resource usage.\n\n**Priority 3: User Dashboard Customization Options - Expected Impact: Increased user engagement and satisfaction.**  \nIntroduce features that allow users to customize their dashboard views, such as selecting which metrics to display and how to visualize them. Personalized experiences can lead to better user retention and overall satisfaction with the platform.",
