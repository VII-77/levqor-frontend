  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe Frequency - Expected Impact: Improved System Performance\nAdjust the frequency of the health probe from daily to every 30 minutes to allow for more timely detection of potential issues. This will help maintain system reliability and performance by proactively identifying problems before they escalate. \n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost Analysis on API Calls - Expected Impact: Enhanced Cost Visibility\nAdd a feature to the cost & runtime analytics that breaks down costs by individual API calls. This will enable the team to identify high-cost endpoints and optimize them, leading to potential cost reductions through more efficient coding or usage limits.\n\n### Priority 3: Introduce User Feedback Mechanism in Dashboard - Expected Impact: Better User Experience\nIncorporate a feedback mechanism on the newly upgraded dashboard that allows users to report issues or suggest improvements directly. This will enhance user experience by making the system more responsive to user needs and fostering a sense of community engagement with the platform.",
