  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alerts Frequency** - Currently, predictive alerts check every hour. Consider adjusting this to every 30 minutes or implementing a dynamic frequency based on system load (e.g., increase frequency during peak hours). - **Expected Impact:** Improved responsiveness to potential issues, leading to reduced downtime and enhanced system reliability.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Resource Usage Cost Analysis Tools** - Develop a tool that evaluates resource usage against associated costs more granularly, allowing for better insights into where costs can be minimized (e.g., optimizing API usage or resource allocation). - **Expected Impact:** Enhanced cost visibility and potential reduction in unnecessary expenditures, leading to more informed budget management.\n\n**Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Real-Time Support Access** - Integrate a live chat feature into the customer experience dashboard, allowing users to easily access support without leaving the platform. This can be paired with an FAQ bot for immediate responses. - **Expected Impact:** Improved user satisfaction and engagement, leading to higher retention rates and reduced frustration during critical operations.",
