  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alerts Logic - Expected Impact: Enhanced performance in system monitoring and reduced false alerts.\n   - Refactor the predictive alerts logic in `scripts/predictive_alerts.py` to implement a more efficient algorithm for tick gap detection and disk usage monitoring. This could involve reducing the frequency of checks to every 2 hours instead of hourly if the system is stable, while ensuring that critical thresholds trigger immediate alerts. This change will improve system performance by decreasing unnecessary checks and reducing resource consumption.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost Analysis for API Usage - Expected Impact: Reduced operational costs and enhanced budgeting for API services.\n   - Develop a new feature in the `/api/runtime-costs` endpoint to provide detailed analytics on the costs associated with each API call, specifically focusing on Stripe fees and OpenAI token usage. This will allow for better tracking of API usage costs and identify areas where optimization or reduction is needed, potentially leading to significant cost savings over time.\n\n### Priority 3: Enhance User Dashboard with Customizable Alerts - Expected Impact: Improved user experience by providing tailored notifications.\n   - Add a feature to the user dashboard that allows users to customize their alert preferences for both stability and cost metrics. Users should be able to set thresholds for when they would like to receive alerts (e.g., disk usage above 75% or unexpected cost spikes). This personalization will enhance user engagement and satisfaction by ensuring they receive only the most relevant and actionable information.",
