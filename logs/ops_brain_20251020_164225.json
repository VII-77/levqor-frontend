  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe and System Resource Monitoring Frequency - Improved system performance and responsiveness.**  \nCurrently, the health probe and system resource probe run daily and hourly, respectively. By evaluating the system load and adjusting the frequency of these checks based on real-time demand (e.g., increasing during peak usage and decreasing during off-peak hours), we can optimize resource usage and reduce potential CPU load, enhancing overall system performance.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost Alerts for Predictive Analytics - Enhanced cost visibility and proactive management.**  \nConfigure additional predictive alerts specifically for cost thresholds, such as notifying the team when projected monthly spending approaches a predefined limit. This proactive approach can help avoid unexpected charges and encourage more efficient resource usage, ultimately leading to cost reduction.\n\n**Priority 3: Simplify Customer Experience with Streamlined User Onboarding - Enhanced user experience and retention.**  \nDevelop a simplified onboarding process for new users, including a guided tutorial that highlights key features and how to leverage them effectively. This will improve the user experience and help reduce churn by ensuring users understand the platform's capabilities from the outset.",
