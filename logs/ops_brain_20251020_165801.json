  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health and Resource Probes - Expected Impact: Improved Performance and Reduced Latency\nImplement asynchronous logging and monitoring for the health probe and system resource probe scripts. By handling logging and data retrieval asynchronously, the system can reduce the latency of these operations, allowing for faster health checks and real-time monitoring without blocking other critical processes. This could improve response times significantly during peak load times.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost-Centric Metrics and Alerts - Expected Impact: Enhanced Cost Visibility and Reduction\nDevelop a refined cost analysis tool that integrates with the existing runtime-costs API to identify cost spikes in real-time and generate alerts when specific thresholds are met. This proactive approach will allow for immediate corrective actions, potentially reducing unnecessary expenses related to high resource consumption, particularly during peak operational times.\n\n### Priority 3: Streamline Customer Experience with a Unified Dashboard - Expected Impact: Enhanced User Engagement and Satisfaction\nCreate a unified dashboard that consolidates all customer-related APIs (e.g., payment status, signed URLs, compliance logs) into a single interface. This would provide users with a more cohesive experience, reducing the need to navigate multiple endpoints for information. Enhanced visibility into customer interactions can lead to higher engagement and satisfaction rates, improving overall customer experience.",
