  "plan": "1. **Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe Frequency** - Adjust the daily health probe to run every 2 hours instead of once a day. This will provide more frequent updates on system health, allowing for quicker detection and response to issues, ultimately enhancing system reliability and performance.\n\n2. **Priority 2: Implement Cost Alerts for Unusual Spending Patterns** - Develop an automated alert system that notifies the finance team when the weekly runtime costs exceed a predefined threshold (e.g., 20% above the average). This proactive measure will help in identifying unexpected cost spikes early, facilitating timely interventions to control costs.\n\n3. **Priority 3: Enhance User Feedback Mechanism on Dashboard** - Integrate a user feedback feature within the dashboard that allows users to report issues or suggest enhancements directly. This will create a more user-centered experience, encouraging engagement and providing valuable insights for future improvements, thus enhancing overall user satisfaction.",
