  "plan": "1. **Priority 1: Implement Asynchronous Processing for Predictive Alerts** - By transitioning the predictive alerts system to an asynchronous model, we can reduce the overall processing time for health checks and alert generation. This will allow for quicker responses to potential issues, enhancing system stability and performance. **Expected Impact:** Improved responsiveness and reduced latency in alert notifications, leading to faster issue resolution.\n\n2. **Priority 2: Optimize API Calls with Caching Mechanisms** - Introduce caching for frequently accessed API endpoints, particularly for the `/api/runtime-costs` and `/api/live-ops`. This will reduce the load on the server by minimizing repetitive database queries and enhance overall performance. **Expected Impact:** Decreased server load and faster response times for users, contributing to better resource utilization and potential cost savings.\n\n3. **Priority 3: Enhance Dashboard User Interface with Customizable Views** - Allow users to customize the dashboard layout and select which metrics they want to display. This will improve user engagement and efficiency by enabling users to focus on the data that matters most to them. **Expected Impact:** Enhanced user experience resulting in increased satisfaction and productivity, leading to better decision-making based on personalized insights.",
