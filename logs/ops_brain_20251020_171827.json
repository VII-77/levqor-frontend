  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alerts Logic - Expected Impact: Improved system efficiency and reduced false positives.**  \nBy refining the logic in the `predictive_alerts.py` script to include machine learning models for anomaly detection, we can reduce unnecessary alerts and improve the accuracy of the predictive system. This would enhance performance by reducing the load on the alert system and focusing resources on genuine issues.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost Efficiency Dashboard Metrics - Expected Impact: Enhanced visibility into cost drivers and improved budgeting.**  \nDevelop additional metrics on the existing dashboard that break down costs by service (e.g., CPU hours, API calls, storage) and correlate them with usage patterns. This will enable better decision-making regarding resource allocation and help identify areas for cost reduction.\n\n**Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Feedback Loop - Expected Impact: Increased user satisfaction and retention.**  \nIntroduce a feature in the customer experience module that allows users to provide feedback on their experience, particularly regarding the new payment system and signed URLs. This feedback can be collected and analyzed for continuous improvement, fostering a more user-centric approach and potentially increasing customer loyalty.",
