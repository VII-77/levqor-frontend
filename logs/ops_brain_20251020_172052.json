  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe and Resource Monitoring Scripts - Expected Impact: Enhanced Performance and Reduced Latency\nReview and refactor the `health_probe.py` and `sys_probe.py` scripts to streamline the monitoring process, reduce resource consumption, and potentially consolidate logging to a more efficient format. By optimizing these scripts, we can decrease the CPU and memory load during peak times, improving overall system performance and response times for predictive alerts and health checks.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost Efficiency Algorithms for Runtime Analytics - Expected Impact: Significant Cost Reduction\nDevelop algorithms that analyze historical data from the `/api/runtime-costs` endpoint to identify patterns in resource usage and associated costs. Implement auto-scaling based on usage patterns to dynamically allocate resources only when needed. This will help in reducing unnecessary usage of CPU hours and OpenAI tokens, leading to a measurable reduction in operational costs.\n\n### Priority 3: Enhance User Interface for Dashboard and Live Ops Monitor - Expected Impact: Improved User Experience and Engagement\nRevamp the dashboard UI and the \"\ud83e\ude7a Live Ops Monitor\" card to include interactive visualizations, such as graphs and alerts, that provide a more intuitive understanding of system health and costs. Incorporate user feedback mechanisms directly within the dashboard to allow users to submit suggestions or report issues. This enhancement will improve user engagement and facilitate quicker decision-making based on real-time data insights.",
