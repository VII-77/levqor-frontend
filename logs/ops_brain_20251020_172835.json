  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe & System Resource Monitoring - Reduce CPU Overhead\n- **Action:** Refactor the health probe and system resource monitoring scripts to aggregate metrics and reduce the frequency of checks. Instead of hourly checks for predictive alerts and daily health probes, consider dynamically adjusting the frequency based on system load.\n- **Expected Impact:** This optimization is expected to decrease CPU usage by up to 20-30%, allowing resources to be reallocated to other processes, thereby enhancing overall system performance.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost-Effective Resource Scaling - Reduce Operating Costs\n- **Action:** Introduce a cloud service auto-scaling feature that analyzes usage patterns and automatically scales resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) up or down based on demand. This can be configured to trigger during peak usage times and reduce capacity during off-peak hours.\n- **Expected Impact:** By aligning resource allocation with actual usage, we can achieve a potential cost reduction of 15-25% on cloud service bills, as resources will only be allocated when necessary.\n\n### Priority 3: Streamline Customer Experience with Unified Dashboard - Enhance User Interaction\n- **Action:** Develop a unified dashboard that combines health metrics, cost analytics, and customer experience features into a single interface, allowing users to access all essential information at a glance. Add customizable widgets to enable users to tailor their view.\n- **Expected Impact:** This enhancement is expected to improve user engagement and satisfaction by providing a more intuitive and accessible interface. Users will spend less time navigating between different sections, leading to a more efficient workflow and increased productivity.",
