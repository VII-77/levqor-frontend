  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe Frequency - Reduce Resource Usage\n- **Action:** Increase the interval between health probe checks from daily to every 12 hours, while maintaining the hourly predictive alert checks.\n- **Expected Impact:** This adjustment will lower CPU and memory usage associated with health checks, allowing resources to be reallocated to other critical operations without compromising system stability.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Adaptive Pricing Model - Enhance Revenue Control\n- **Action:** Develop an adaptive pricing model that dynamically adjusts based on usage patterns, demand forecasting, and cost analytics provided by the new `/api/runtime-costs` endpoint.\n- **Expected Impact:** This could lead to significant cost reduction through more efficient resource allocation and pricing strategies, ultimately increasing revenue while offering competitive pricing to customers.\n\n### Priority 3: Improve User Dashboard Customization - Enhance User Experience\n- **Action:** Introduce customizable dashboard elements that allow users to select which metrics they want to view on their dashboard (e.g., health metrics, cost analytics, live ops stats).\n- **Expected Impact:** By allowing users to tailor their experience, satisfaction and engagement will likely increase, leading to improved retention rates and overall user experience.",
