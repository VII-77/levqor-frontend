  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe and Resource Monitoring Scripts - Expected Impact: Improved system responsiveness and reduced resource consumption by fine-tuning the interval and threshold settings for health checks and system probes. This will ensure that the monitoring processes do not consume excessive CPU or memory, allowing for better overall performance during peak usage times.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost Efficiency Analytics - Expected Impact: Develop a comprehensive cost analysis tool that identifies patterns in resource usage and associated costs (e.g., CPU hours, API calls, etc.) to help teams make data-driven decisions on resource allocation. This system can provide insights for optimizing usage patterns, ultimately leading to reduced operational costs.\n\n### Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Real-Time Notifications - Expected Impact: Integrate a real-time notification system (e.g., via WebSocket or push notifications) for customers to receive updates on their transactions, signed URLs, and account activities. This enhancement will improve user engagement and satisfaction by keeping customers informed in a timely manner, fostering a better overall experience.",
