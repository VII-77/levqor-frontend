  "plan": "### Priority 1: Implement Caching Mechanisms for API Responses - Expected Impact: \nBy introducing caching for frequently accessed API endpoints, especially the `/api/live-ops` and `/api/customer/signed-url/<client_id>`, we can significantly reduce response times and decrease the load on the system. This will lead to improved performance, especially during peak usage times, and result in a better overall user experience.\n\n### Priority 2: Optimize Resource Usage in the System Resource Probe - Expected Impact:\nReview and refine the thresholds and monitoring intervals in the `sys_probe.py` and `health_probe.py` scripts. By adjusting the resource usage thresholds based on historical data and optimizing the frequency of health checks, we can reduce CPU and memory consumption. This can potentially lower operational costs while maintaining system reliability.\n\n### Priority 3: Streamline Payment Processing with Batch Operations - Expected Impact:\nIntroduce functionality in the `stripe_live_guard.py` to handle batch processing of invoices and payments. By allowing multiple transactions to be processed in a single API call, we can reduce the number of requests made to the Stripe API, leading to faster transaction times for users and lower transaction fees due to reduced API usage. This enhancement will significantly improve the customer experience during checkout.",
