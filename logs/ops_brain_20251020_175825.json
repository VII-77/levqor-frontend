  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe and System Resource Monitoring Frequency - Expected Impact: Improved System Performance\nReduce the frequency of the health probe and system resource monitoring from hourly to every two hours, while maintaining essential checks. This will reduce CPU and RAM usage during peak times while still providing adequate monitoring, allowing for better resource allocation across the system.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost Alerts for Exceeding Thresholds - Expected Impact: Enhanced Cost Control\nIntroduce an automated notification system that triggers alerts when costs exceed predefined thresholds, such as CPU hours or Stripe fees. This will enable proactive management of expenses and help to identify cost spikes before they become problematic, ultimately leading to better budget adherence.\n\n### Priority 3: Create a User Feedback Mechanism on the Dashboard - Expected Impact: Enhanced User Experience\nDevelop an integrated feedback widget on the dashboard where users can submit suggestions and report issues directly. This will foster user engagement, provide valuable insights for further improvements, and ensure that the platform evolves according to user needs, enhancing overall satisfaction.",
