  "plan": "### Priority 1: Implement Caching Mechanisms for API Responses - Expected Impact: Enhanced performance by reducing response times and server load. Utilizing caching for frequently accessed API endpoints (like `/api/live-ops` and `/api/customer/signed-url/<client_id>`) can significantly decrease the time taken to process requests, leading to a smoother user experience and allowing resources to be allocated to other tasks.\n\n### Priority 2: Optimize Resource Utilization with Autoscaling - Expected Impact: Cost reduction through improved resource management. By implementing an autoscaling feature for CPU and memory based on real-time monitoring from the System Resource Probe, we can adjust resource allocation dynamically, reducing waste during low-traffic periods while ensuring sufficient capacity during peak times.\n\n### Priority 3: Enhance User Interface with Interactive Dashboards - Expected Impact: Improved user experience through better visibility and control. Upgrading the dashboard interface to include more interactive elements, such as drill-down capabilities for health and cost metrics, will allow users to engage more deeply with the data and make informed decisions quickly, leading to higher satisfaction and engagement.",
