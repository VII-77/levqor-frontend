  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alerts Frequency** - Adjust the predictive alerts frequency from hourly to every 30 minutes, focusing on high-traffic periods to ensure timely responses to potential issues. This could help in identifying and addressing system bottlenecks quicker, ultimately improving system performance and uptime.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost-Effective Resource Scaling** - Introduce an automated scaling mechanism that adjusts resource allocation (CPU, RAM) based on real-time monitoring data, particularly during peak usage times. This action could reduce costs associated with over-provisioning resources while ensuring that performance remains optimal.\n\n**Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Real-Time Notifications** - Integrate real-time notifications for users on important actions (like successful payment, generated signed URLs, or data export completion) through email and in-app messages. This enhancement will improve user engagement and satisfaction by keeping users informed, thereby fostering a better overall experience.",
