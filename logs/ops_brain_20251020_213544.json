  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health and System Probes - Enhanced Performance Monitoring\n**Action:** Refactor the health and system monitoring scripts to incorporate asynchronous processing and reduce the frequency of logging operations, allowing for less resource consumption during peak hours.  \n**Expected Impact:** This will improve overall system performance by minimizing CPU and memory usage during monitoring tasks, leading to faster response times and better resource allocation for other critical operations.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost Alerts for Predictive Analytics - Cost Reduction\n**Action:** Enhance the cost analytics dashboard by integrating real-time notification alerts when projected costs exceed a user-defined threshold. This can include alerts for spikes in CPU hours, OpenAI token usage, or Stripe fees.  \n**Expected Impact:** This proactive approach will help to promptly identify and mitigate unexpected cost increases, fostering more efficient resource allocation and budgeting, ultimately leading to cost savings.\n\n### Priority 3: Streamline Customer Experience Workflow - User Experience Enhancement\n**Action:** Introduce a unified customer portal where users can manage their subscriptions, view payment history, and access signed URLs in one seamless interface, reducing the need for multiple API calls.  \n**Expected Impact:** This will enhance the user experience by simplifying navigation and reducing friction in accessing services, leading to higher user satisfaction and potentially increased retention rates.",
