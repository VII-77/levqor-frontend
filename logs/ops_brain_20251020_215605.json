  "plan": "Priority 1: **Optimize Predictive Alerts Frequency** - **Expected Impact:** By adjusting the predictive alerts check frequency from hourly to every 30 minutes for critical metrics (e.g., tick gaps and disk usage), we can enhance the responsiveness of the system to potential issues. This improvement will allow for quicker remediation actions, ultimately improving system uptime and performance.\n\nPriority 2: **Implement Cost Monitoring Alerts** - **Expected Impact:** Set up alerts for when operational costs exceed a predefined threshold (e.g., 10% above average weekly costs). This proactive measure will enable the team to identify unexpected spikes in expenses related to CPU hours, OpenAI tokens, or Stripe fees, allowing for timely intervention and cost control.\n\nPriority 3: **Enhance User Dashboard Customizability** - **Expected Impact:** Introduce features that allow users to customize their dashboard, such as rearranging cards, selecting which metrics to display, and setting personal alerts. This enhancement will improve user engagement and satisfaction, as users will have the ability to tailor their experience to better suit their monitoring needs.",
