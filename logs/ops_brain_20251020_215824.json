  "plan": "### Priority 1: Implement Caching Mechanisms for API Responses - Expected Impact: By introducing caching for frequently accessed API responses, such as `/api/live-ops` and `/api/customer/signed-url/<client_id>`, we can reduce server load, decrease response times, and improve overall system performance. This would alleviate pressure during peak usage times, leading to a more responsive application.\n\n### Priority 2: Analyze and Optimize Resource Usage in Scripts - Expected Impact: Conduct a thorough review and profiling of the newly implemented scripts (especially `stripe_live_guard.py`, `customer_experience.py`, and those handling monitoring) to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource usage. This could lead to reduced CPU and memory consumption, thereby lowering operational costs associated with cloud services and improving the system's scalability.\n\n### Priority 3: Enhance the User Interface for Real-Time Monitoring Dashboards - Expected Impact: Redesign the \"\ud83e\ude7a Live Ops Monitor\" and \"\ud83d\udcca Health & Costs\" dashboard cards to include more intuitive visualizations, user-friendly controls, and actionable insights. By making the data more accessible and easier to interpret, we can significantly enhance the user experience, leading to quicker decision-making and improved satisfaction for stakeholders monitoring system performance.",
