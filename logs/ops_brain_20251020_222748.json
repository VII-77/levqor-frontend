  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Resource Probes - Enhanced Monitoring Efficiency\n**Action:** Implement an adaptive sampling rate for the system resource probes based on system load, reducing the frequency of checks during low-load periods and increasing it during high-load periods. This can be achieved by dynamically adjusting the monitoring interval based on CPU and memory usage metrics.  \n**Expected Impact:** This optimization will reduce the overhead caused by continuous monitoring, leading to improved system performance and reduced server load.\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Cost Alerts for Budget Management - Proactive Financial Oversight\n**Action:** Introduce a feature that alerts administrators when costs exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., 80% of the monthly budget). This can be integrated into the existing predictive alerts system, utilizing historical cost data for trend analysis.  \n**Expected Impact:** Proactively notifying users about potential overspending will help prevent budget overruns and allow for timely adjustments in resource usage or operational strategies.\n\n### Priority 3: Streamline Customer Experience with Dashboard Widgets - Enhanced User Interface\n**Action:** Develop customizable dashboard widgets that allow users to select and arrange the metrics most relevant to them, such as cost summaries, system health, or usage statistics. This feature should include drag-and-drop functionality and save user preferences.  \n**Expected Impact:** This enhancement will improve user engagement and satisfaction by offering a personalized experience, making it easier for users to access key information quickly, thereby streamlining their workflow.",
