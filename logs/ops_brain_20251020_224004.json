  "plan": "Priority 1: **Optimize Real-Time Monitoring Scripts** - Refactor the `sys_probe.py` and `health_probe.py` scripts to utilize asynchronous programming or multi-threading. This will reduce the latency in logging and monitoring system resources, allowing for faster detection of issues and improving overall system responsiveness. **Expected Impact:** Enhanced performance of monitoring systems, leading to quicker response times for alerts and reduced downtime.\n\nPriority 2: **Implement Cost Efficiency Metrics** - Develop a cost optimization module that analyzes the API usage patterns and identifies underutilized resources or features within the system. This module should leverage the existing `/api/runtime-costs` endpoint to provide recommendations for optimizing resource allocation and scaling based on usage. **Expected Impact:** Reduced operational costs by eliminating wastage and ensuring resources are used efficiently, resulting in potential savings on cloud service fees.\n\nPriority 3: **Enhance Customer Experience with Feedback Loop** - Introduce a customer feedback mechanism integrated within the `Customer Experience 2.0` phase that allows users to report issues or suggest improvements directly from the interface. This feature could include a simple form or rating system accessible from the dashboard. **Expected Impact:** Improved user satisfaction and engagement by allowing customers to voice their opinions and influence the development of new features or improvements, leading to a more tailored user experience.",
