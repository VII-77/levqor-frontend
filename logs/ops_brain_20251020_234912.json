  "plan": "1. **Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alerts System** - Enhance the predictive alerts mechanism by implementing a more sophisticated anomaly detection algorithm that reduces false positives and minimizes alert fatigue. This could involve machine learning techniques to improve accuracy. **Expected Impact:** Increased reliability of alerts, leading to better resource allocation and quicker incident response while reducing unnecessary notifications.\n\n2. **Priority 2: Implement Cost Analysis for API Usage** - Introduce a cost analysis feature to monitor and analyze the costs associated with each API call in the new payment and customer experience features. This should include tracking usage patterns and identifying high-cost endpoints. **Expected Impact:** Improved cost efficiency by identifying and optimizing expensive API calls, leading to potential cost reductions in operational expenses.\n\n3. **Priority 3: Enhance Dashboard Interactivity** - Integrate advanced filtering and reporting capabilities into the dashboard, allowing users to customize views and generate reports based on specific metrics (e.g., alert history, cost breakdowns). This can also include export options for data analysis. **Expected Impact:** Improved user experience by providing users with relevant insights tailored to their needs, resulting in better decision-making and increased satisfaction with the platform.",
