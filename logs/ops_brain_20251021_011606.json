  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe Frequency** - Reduce the frequency of the health probe checks from once per day to every 12 hours. This will minimize the processing load on the system without significantly compromising the monitoring capabilities, leading to better performance and resource utilization.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost Analysis Alerts** - Introduce a cost monitoring mechanism that sends alerts when weekly costs exceed a predefined threshold. By proactively managing expenses, this will help in identifying and mitigating any unexpected cost spikes, aiding in overall cost reduction.\n\n**Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Real-time Support Chat** - Integrate a real-time chat feature on the customer dashboard for immediate assistance. This enhancement will improve user experience by providing instant support, increasing customer satisfaction, and potentially reducing churn rates.",
