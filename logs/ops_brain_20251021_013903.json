  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alerts Performance** - Implement multi-threading or asynchronous execution in the `predictive_alerts.py` script to handle alerts more efficiently, especially during peak times. This will reduce latency in alert delivery and improve system responsiveness.\n\n**Expected Impact:** Faster response times for alerts will enhance operational efficiency, allowing teams to react more swiftly to potential issues, thereby minimizing downtime.\n\n---\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost Analysis for Stripe Transactions** - Develop a feature in the `/api/runtime-costs` endpoint to analyze and visualize costs associated with Stripe transactions, such as fees per transaction and overall expenditure trends. This can help identify areas for cost reduction.\n\n**Expected Impact:** Improved visibility into payment processing costs will enable better financial decision-making and help identify opportunities for cost savings, ultimately optimizing budget allocation for payment services.\n\n---\n\n**Priority 3: Enhance User Experience with Customizable Dashboard** - Introduce user preferences that allow users to customize the dashboard view, such as selecting which metrics to display prominently or adjusting the layout. This can be achieved by adding a settings section to the dashboard.\n\n**Expected Impact:** A more personalized user interface will lead to increased user satisfaction and engagement, as users can tailor their experience to focus on metrics most relevant to their needs, thus enhancing overall usability.",
