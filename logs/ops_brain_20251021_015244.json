  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alerting Frequency** - **Reduce the frequency of predictive alert checks from hourly to every two hours.** - This adjustment will decrease the system load on the scheduler and CPU usage, potentially improving overall system performance while still maintaining sufficient monitoring capabilities.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost-Effective Resource Scaling** - **Introduce an automated scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on real-time CPU and memory usage.** - This will help in optimizing costs by ensuring that resources are only utilized when needed, reducing idle resource costs during low-usage periods.\n\n**Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Real-Time Notifications** - **Integrate a real-time notification system for users to receive updates on their transactions, including payment confirmations and invoice statuses.** - This will improve user experience by providing timely information, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and engagement with the platform.",
