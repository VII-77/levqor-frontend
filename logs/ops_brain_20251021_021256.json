  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize API Response Times - Implement caching for frequently accessed API endpoints (e.g., `/api/live-ops`, `/api/customer/signed-url/<client_id>`). - Expected Impact: Reducing the load on the server and improving response times for users by up to 50%, leading to enhanced overall performance and user satisfaction.\n\n### Priority 2: Review and Optimize Resource Utilization - Conduct a thorough review of CPU and memory usage against the newly implemented monitoring systems (`sys_probe.py` and `health_probe.py`) to identify and eliminate unnecessary resource consumption. - Expected Impact: This can lead to a reduction in operational costs by optimizing resource allocation, potentially saving 15-20% on cloud hosting expenses.\n\n### Priority 3: Enhance User Onboarding Process - Develop an interactive tutorial or guided walkthrough for new users to familiarize them with the new features (e.g., predictive alerts, dashboard functionalities). - Expected Impact: Improved user experience and retention rates by making it easier for new customers to navigate the system, which can lead to a 10-15% increase in user engagement and satisfaction.",
