  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alerts Engine** - Review the predictive alerts engine for computational efficiency, focusing on reducing the frequency of checks and the complexity of conditions in the scripts. This could involve consolidating checks into fewer operations or using more efficient algorithms for tick gap detection and disk usage monitoring. **Expected Impact:** Improved performance and reduced server load, leading to faster response times and potentially lower operational costs.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost Alerts and Budget Controls** - Develop a feature that allows users to set budget thresholds and receive alerts when projected costs approach those limits based on real-time analytics from the /api/runtime-costs endpoint. This could involve integrating a simple budgeting interface into the existing dashboard. **Expected Impact:** Enhanced cost visibility for users, enabling better financial management and proactive cost control.\n\n**Priority 3: Enhance User Dashboard Customization Options** - Introduce user-specific dashboard customization settings that allow users to choose which metrics to display and in what format. This could include the ability to rearrange components, select favorite metrics, and save different views for different user roles. **Expected Impact:** Improved user experience and engagement, as users can tailor their dashboards to better fit their needs and workflows, increasing overall satisfaction with the platform.",
