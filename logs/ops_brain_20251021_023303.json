  "plan": "Priority 1: **Optimize Health Probe and Resource Monitoring Frequency** - Adjust the health probe and system resource monitoring frequency from every hour to every 30 minutes and analyze the impact on system performance. This change could reduce the likelihood of missing critical issues by providing more frequent data points, leading to improved overall stability and performance.\n\nPriority 2: **Implement Cost Analysis Alerts** - Develop a cost analysis alert system that triggers notifications when the weekly operational costs exceed a certain threshold (e.g., 10% higher than the previous month). This proactive approach will help identify areas of potential overspending or inefficiencies, ultimately driving a cost reduction in operations.\n\nPriority 3: **Enhance Customer Experience with Real-time Support Integration** - Introduce a live chat feature on the customer dashboard that allows users to connect with support agents directly. This enhancement will improve user experience by offering immediate assistance for inquiries related to payments, account management, and compliance, fostering increased customer satisfaction and retention.",
