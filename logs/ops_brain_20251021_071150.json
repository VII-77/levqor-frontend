  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alerts Frequency - Reduce Alert Fatigue and Improve Responsiveness**  \nAction: Implement a dynamic alert frequency system that adjusts the checking interval based on system load and health status. For instance, during peak usage hours, increase the cooldown period between alerts, while decreasing it during low-load times.  \nExpected Impact: This will minimize alert fatigue for operations teams, enhance focus on critical issues, and ensure timely responses to genuine system anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost Monitoring Alerts - Enhance Financial Oversight and Prevent Budget Overruns**  \nAction: Establish real-time alerts for cost thresholds (e.g., when projected costs exceed set budgets for CPU hours, OpenAI tokens, or Stripe fees) integrated with existing predictive alert systems.  \nExpected Impact: This proactive monitoring will help identify and mitigate unexpected expenses, leading to improved budget management and cost reduction.\n\n---\n\n**Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Live Support Integration - Improve User Satisfaction and Retention**  \nAction: Integrate a live chat support option into the Customer Experience 2.0 features, allowing users to get immediate assistance while using signed URLs or managing their accounts.  \nExpected Impact: This will enhance user experience by providing instant support, reducing abandonment rates, and improving customer satisfaction, ultimately driving user retention and loyalty.",
