  "plan": "1. **Priority 1: Optimize Predictive Alert System** - Analyze the frequency and thresholds of the predictive alerts. By refining the parameters for tick gaps and disk usage monitoring, as well as the frequency of alerts, we can reduce unnecessary notifications while ensuring critical issues are still flagged. **Expected Impact:** Improved system performance and reduced alert fatigue for operators.\n\n2. **Priority 2: Implement Cost Efficiency Review** - Conduct a comprehensive review of the API usage and the associated costs for external services such as Stripe and OpenAI. Identify underutilized features or services that can be scaled back or eliminated. **Expected Impact:** Reduced operational costs and improved budget management, allowing for reallocation of resources to more crucial areas.\n\n3. **Priority 3: Enhance User Interface on Dashboard** - Gather user feedback on the new dashboard features and identify areas for improvement, such as simplifying navigation or adding tooltips for complex data points. Implement a user-friendly design update to improve clarity and accessibility. **Expected Impact:** Enhanced user experience, leading to increased engagement and more efficient decision-making from operators.",
