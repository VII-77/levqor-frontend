  "plan": "Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe Frequency - By increasing the frequency of the health probe checks from daily to every 12 hours, we can ensure more timely detection of issues and reduce system downtime. This proactive approach can enhance system reliability and user satisfaction.\n\nPriority 2: Implement Cost Caps for API Usage - Introduce a feature that allows users to set maximum spending limits on API usage. This will not only help in cost reduction for users but also enhance budget control and transparency, leading to improved user trust and retention.\n\nPriority 3: Streamline Customer Experience with Unified Dashboard - Develop a centralized dashboard that combines health metrics, cost analytics, and user account management features. This will provide users with a holistic view of their operations, enhancing accessibility and overall user experience while reducing the need for multiple interfaces.",
