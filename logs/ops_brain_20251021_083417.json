  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Health and System Resource Probes** - Review and refine the thresholds used in the health and system resource probes to minimize false positives and negatives. This could involve adjusting CPU and memory thresholds to better suit real-world usage patterns. **Expected Impact:** Improved accuracy of alerts and system monitoring, leading to more efficient resource usage and reduced unnecessary alert fatigue.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost-Benefit Analysis for API Calls** - Develop a mechanism to track and analyze the costs associated with each API endpoint, particularly those involved in payment processing and data export. This should include a cost-benefit analysis feature that informs decisions on resource allocation and API usage limits. **Expected Impact:** Enhanced visibility into operational costs, enabling better budgeting and potential renegotiation with service providers to reduce expenses.\n\n**Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Real-time Notifications** - Introduce a real-time notification system for customers regarding their payment statuses, signed URL expirations, and any significant account changes. This could be accomplished through webhooks or a dedicated notification system integrated with existing customer experience features. **Expected Impact:** Improved user engagement and satisfaction by keeping customers informed, leading to better retention rates and trust in the platform.",
