  "plan": "**Priority 1: Performance Optimization - Implement Asynchronous Processing for Heavy Tasks**  \nBy transitioning resource-intensive scripts (like payment processing and health probes) to asynchronous execution, we can significantly improve system responsiveness and reduce latency during peak load times. This will lead to more efficient resource utilization and a smoother user experience, particularly during high-traffic events.\n\n**Priority 2: Cost Reduction - Introduce Scheduled Resource Scaling**  \nImplement an automated scaling solution that dynamically adjusts CPU and memory resources based on real-time traffic and usage metrics. By scaling down during off-peak hours and up during peak hours, we can optimize costs associated with cloud resource usage, leading to a more cost-effective operation without sacrificing performance.\n\n**Priority 3: User Experience Enhancement - Enhance Dashboard Customization Options**  \nAllow users to customize their dashboard views by adding/removing cards, adjusting metrics displayed, and saving preferred layouts. This personalization will lead to a more user-friendly experience, enabling users to focus on the metrics that matter most to them, thus improving overall satisfaction with the platform.",
