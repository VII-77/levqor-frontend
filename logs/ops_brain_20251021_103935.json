  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Resource Usage in Real-Time Monitoring - Expected Impact: Enhanced Performance\nImplement a more granular threshold management system for the real-time monitoring of CPU, RAM, and disk usage. By fine-tuning the thresholds based on historical performance data and predictive analytics, the system can reduce false positives and improve resource allocation. This can lead to better performance under load, reducing the chances of downtime and ensuring that resources are used efficiently.\n\n### Priority 2: Review and Optimize Payment Processing Fees - Expected Impact: Cost Reduction\nConduct a thorough analysis of the payment processing fees associated with Stripe and other payment gateways used in the system. Identify opportunities to negotiate lower fees based on transaction volumes or to explore alternative payment processors that may offer better rates. This could significantly reduce costs associated with transactions, enhancing overall profitability.\n\n### Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Real-Time Notifications - Expected Impact: Increased User Satisfaction\nDevelop and implement a real-time notification system that informs users about important events, such as successful payments, upcoming subscription renewals, or account changes. This feature can enhance user engagement and satisfaction, leading to a better overall experience and potentially reducing churn rates. Integrating with existing communication channels (e.g., email, SMS, or push notifications) would further streamline user interactions.",
