  "plan": "### Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe Frequency - Expected Impact: Improved System Performance\nCurrently, the health probe runs daily at a fixed time (07:55 UTC), but this could lead to potential performance bottlenecks during peak usage hours. By implementing a dynamic scheduling system that adjusts the frequency of the health probes based on real-time system load, we can ensure that system resources are utilized more efficiently, reducing the chances of performance degradation during critical operations.\n\n### Priority 2: Refine Cost Analytics with Predictive Modeling - Expected Impact: Enhanced Cost Reduction\nIntegrate predictive modeling into the current cost analytics system to forecast expenses based on historical usage patterns, spikes, and trends. By anticipating costs, we can proactively manage resource allocation and identify potential cost-saving opportunities, such as optimizing resource usage or renegotiating pricing with service providers, ultimately leading to a significant reduction in operational costs.\n\n### Priority 3: Enhance Customer Experience with Real-Time Notifications - Expected Impact: Increased User Satisfaction\nImplement real-time notifications for customers via the existing Telegram integration to inform them of critical system events, such as downtime or billing issues. This enhancement will improve user engagement and satisfaction by keeping customers informed and allowing them to take timely action when necessary. Additionally, consider adding a feedback mechanism post-notification to gather user insights, which can guide future product improvements.",
