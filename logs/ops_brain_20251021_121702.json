  "plan": "**Priority 1: Optimize Health Probe Frequency** - Increase the frequency of the health probe checks from daily to every 12 hours. This will enhance the responsiveness to system health issues, potentially reducing downtime and improving overall system stability.\n\n**Priority 2: Implement Cost Alerts for Exceeding Budgets** - Introduce a threshold alert system that notifies stakeholders when projected costs exceed predefined budgets based on historical data. This proactive measure will help in managing expenses and optimizing resource allocation, leading to cost reduction.\n\n**Priority 3: Improve Customer Experience with Enhanced API Documentation** - Develop and publish comprehensive API documentation that includes usage examples, error codes, and troubleshooting tips. Enhanced documentation will empower users to integrate and use the APIs more effectively, leading to improved user satisfaction and engagement.",
