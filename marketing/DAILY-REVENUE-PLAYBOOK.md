# 📅 DAILY REVENUE PLAYBOOK - Simple Routine for Growth

## Overview
A simple, actionable daily routine designed for non-technical founders who want to drive revenue without getting overwhelmed. Takes 2-3 hours/day max.

**Goal:** Turn your DFY automation service from "side project" into a revenue engine.

---

## 🌅 EVERY MORNING (30 minutes)

### ✅ Revenue Check (10 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. Open Stripe dashboard → Check for new payments
   - 1 DFY Starter (£99) = 🎉
   - 1 DFY Professional (£249) = 🎉🎉
   - 1 Subscription (£29-£299) = 🎉🎉🎉 (recurring!)

2. Log revenue in a simple spreadsheet:
   - Date | Customer | Plan | Amount | Status
   - Example: "Nov 15 | John Doe | DFY Professional | £249 | Paid"

3. Celebrate wins (seriously, acknowledge every sale)

**Why this matters:** You need to KNOW if your marketing is working. If you got 0 sales yesterday, double down on content today.

---

### ✅ Inbox Triage (10 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. Check email for:
   - New leads (people asking questions about DFY/pricing)
   - Existing client questions (during support period)
   - Stripe payment confirmations

2. **Golden rule:** Reply to EVERY inquiry within 1 hour
   - Lead asking about pricing? Reply immediately with a helpful answer + link to pricing page
   - Client has a question? Answer it within 1 hour (this builds trust and referrals)

3. Tag urgent vs. non-urgent
   - Urgent: New lead, client issue
   - Non-urgent: Newsletter, spam, random stuff

**Why this matters:** Speed wins. The founder who replies in 1 hour gets the sale. The founder who replies in 1 day loses to competitors.

---

### ✅ DM/Comment Check (10 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. Check TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, LinkedIn for:
   - Comments on your videos/posts
   - DMs asking about automation
   - Questions about Levqor

2. Reply to ALL comments (even "nice video!")
   - Builds engagement (algorithm loves it)
   - Turns lurkers into leads

3. If someone DMs asking about DFY, send them:
   - Link to pricing page: levqor.ai/pricing
   - Offer to answer questions: "What would you like to automate?"

**Why this matters:** Social media is WHERE your customers are. If you ignore DMs, you're leaving money on the table.

## 🎥 CONTENT BLOCK (30-60 minutes)

**Time:** Mid-morning (10am-12pm) or whenever you have energy

### Option 1: TikTok/Shorts (30 minutes)

**Goal:** 1 Reddit post per week (or 3-4 per month)

---

### Option 3: LinkedIn Post (15 minutes)

**What to do (if short on time):**
1. Repurpose a TikTok script or Reddit post as a LinkedIn text post
2. Share a quick win: "Saved a client 20 hours/week with this automation..."
3. Add a soft CTA: "If you need something similar, check out levqor.ai"

**Time breakdown:**
- Write: 10 minutes
- Post: 5 minutes

**Goal:** 2-3 LinkedIn posts per week

---

## 🛠️ CLIENT DELIVERY BLOCK (1-2 hours)

**Time:** Afternoon (1pm-3pm)

### ✅ If you have active DFY projects:

**What to do:**
1. Work on the automation build
   - Connect tools
   - Test the workflow
   - Debug any issues
   - Document how it works

2. Use the checklist (see below) to track progress

3. Communicate with the client:
   - "Just finished building the first workflow, testing it now"
   - "Everything's working, I'll deliver tomorrow with docs + video"

**Checklist for "Done":**
- [ ] Automation built and connected to client's tools
- [ ] Tested with 5-10 real examples (no errors)
- [ ] Documentation written (step-by-step guide)
- [ ] Loom video recorded (5-10 min walkthrough)
- [ ] Handover email sent with all deliverables
- [ ] Client confirmed they received everything

**Goal:** Deliver on time (48h for Starter, 3-4 days for Professional, 7 days for Enterprise)

---

### ✅ If you have NO active projects:

**What to do (prospecting):**
1. Reach out to 5-10 potential leads:
   - Cold outreach on LinkedIn: "Hey [Name], I help [their industry] automate [specific task]. Would you be interested in a quick chat?"
   - Reply to Reddit comments: "I automated something similar for $100. Happy to walk you through it if you want."
   - Email your network: "I'm building automations for small businesses. Know anyone drowning in manual work?"

2. Optimize your website/pricing page
   - Review copy from `PRICING-COPY-LEVQOR.md`
   - Update any weak sections

3. Plan next week's content (batch TikTok scripts, Reddit posts)

**Goal:** Fill the pipeline with 3-5 warm leads per week

---

## 🌙 EVENING REVIEW (10-15 minutes)

**Time:** End of day (6pm-8pm)

### ✅ Log What You Shipped (5 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. Answer these 3 questions in a simple doc/spreadsheet:
   - **What did I ship today?** (1 TikTok, 1 Reddit post, 1 DFY build, etc.)
   - **What got traction?** (video hit 5K views, Reddit post got 50 upvotes, got 2 new leads)
   - **What should I do more of?** (TikToks about "save 20 hours/week" are working, double down)

2. Review tomorrow's priorities:
   - Any urgent client deliveries?
   - Any hot leads to follow up with?
   - Content planned for tomorrow?

**Goal:** Build momentum. Seeing daily progress = motivation to keep going.

---

### ✅ Metrics Snapshot (5 minutes)

**What to track (simple spreadsheet):**

| Metric | Goal | This Week |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Revenue | £500/week | £247 (halfway there!) |
| New leads | 10/week | 7 |
| DFY projects delivered | 2/week | 1 |
| TikToks posted | 5/week | 3 |
| Reddit posts | 1/week | 0 (post tomorrow!) |

**Why this matters:** You can't improve what you don't measure. Keep it simple, but track the basics.

---

### ✅ Celebrate Wins (5 minutes)

**What to do:**
- Got a sale today? Celebrate (tell your partner, tweet about it, treat yourself)
- Got a great testimonial? Screenshot it and save for future marketing
- Hit a milestone (10 DFY builds delivered, 100K TikTok views)? Share it publicly

**Why this matters:** Running a business is HARD. Celebrate the small wins to stay motivated.

---

## 📊 WEEKLY REVIEW (Sunday, 30 minutes)

### ✅ Look Back at the Week

**What to do:**
1. Total revenue for the week
   - Did you hit your goal (£500? £1,000? £2,000?)?
   - If not, why? (not enough leads? not enough content? pricing too low?)

2. Content performance
   - Which TikTok got the most views?
   - Which Reddit post got the most engagement?
   - What topic resonated most?

3. Client feedback
   - Any testimonials from delivered projects?
   - Any complaints or issues?
   - What can you improve?

---

### ✅ Plan Next Week

**What to do:**
1. Set revenue goal for next week
   - Example: "I want to close 2 DFY Professional builds = £498"

2. Plan content
   - Which 5 TikTok scripts will you film?
   - Which Reddit post will you write?
   - Any LinkedIn posts planned?

3. Block time for delivery
   - If you have 2 active projects, block Mon-Wed for builds, Thu-Fri for content

**Goal:** Don't wing it. A simple plan = more sales.

---

## 🚀 SCALING CHECKLIST (As You Grow)

### When you hit £2,000/month revenue:
- [ ] Hire a VA to handle intake forms and scheduling (£300-500/month)
- [ ] Invest in paid ads (£100-200/month to test Facebook/Google)

### When you hit £5,000/month revenue:
- [ ] Hire a junior automation builder to handle DFY builds (£1,000-1,500/month)
- [ ] You focus on sales, content, and strategy

### When you hit £10,000/month revenue:
- [ ] Build a small team (2-3 people)
- [ ] Systemize everything (SOPs for builds, support, sales)
- [ ] Transition to CEO role (you lead, team executes)

---

## 💡 MINDSET REMINDERS

### 1. Consistency > Perfection
Post a "good enough" TikTok every day instead of a "perfect" video once a month.

### 2. Speed Wins
Reply to leads in 1 hour, not 1 day. Deliver DFY builds on time, not late.

### 3. Track Everything
You can't improve what you don't measure. Log revenue, leads, content performance.

### 4. Celebrate Small Wins
Got your first £99 sale? That's HUGE. Celebrate it.

### 5. Stay Focused
Don't chase shiny objects. Stick to this playbook for 90 days before changing strategy.
