## COMPARISON: DFY vs SUBSCRIPTION

### Choose DFY if you:
- Need automation NOW (48 hours to 7 days)
- Have 1-7 specific workflows in mind
- Want a one-time investment with no recurring costs
- Prefer to pay once and own the workflows outright

### Choose Subscription if you:
- Need ongoing automation support every month
- Want to build workflows continuously as your business grows
- Prefer predictable monthly costs vs. large one-time payments
- Need monitoring, updates, and optimization for existing workflows

### Best of both worlds:
**Start with DFY to get quick wins, then add a subscription for ongoing automation.**

Example: Buy DFY Professional (£249 for 3 workflows) to automate your biggest pain points this week. Then subscribe to Growth (£79/month) to keep building 3 new workflows every month as you scale.
