## The Process - 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Pay & Fill the Intake Form (5 minutes)
**What happens:**
- Choose your DFY plan (Starter £99 / Professional £249 / Enterprise £599)
- Complete secure Stripe checkout
- Receive instant email with a 5-minute intake form

**What we ask in the form:**
- What manual task is eating your time? (e.g., "Copy leads from website to CRM")
- Which tools do you use? (e.g., Gmail, Google Sheets, HubSpot)
- What's the desired outcome? (e.g., "Every new lead automatically in CRM within 5 minutes")
- Preferred contact method (email, call, or async)

**Timeline:** 5 minutes

---

### Step 2: Kickoff Call (15-30 minutes, optional)
**What happens:**
- We schedule a quick call (or async if you prefer)
- We audit your current process and confirm the automation design
- You grant access to tools (read-only where possible)
- We answer any questions and set expectations

**What you need to bring:**
- Logins for tools you want to connect (or invite us as collaborators)
- Example data (1-2 real examples of the task you want automated)
- Your availability for handoff (we're flexible)

**Timeline:** 15-30 minutes (scheduled within 24 hours of purchase)

---

### Step 3: We Build It, Test It, Deliver It (24-48 hours)
**What happens:**
- We build your automation using your tools and real data
- We test it end-to-end to ensure it works perfectly
- We create documentation explaining how it works
- We record a Loom walkthrough showing you how to use/modify it
- We hand it off with 7-30 days of email support (depending on your tier)

**What you get:**
- ✅ Fully-built automation (connected to your accounts)
- ✅ End-to-end testing report
- ✅ Step-by-step documentation
- ✅ Video walkthrough (Loom)
- ✅ 7-30 days of support (questions, tweaks, bug fixes)

**Timeline:** 24-48 hours for Starter, 3-4 days for Professional, 7 days for Enterprise

## What's Included in Every DFY Build

### ✅ Production-Ready Automation
No "beta" or "draft" nonsense. We deliver a fully functional workflow that works with your real data, not test accounts.

### ✅ Error Handling & Monitoring
We add error handling so if something fails, it retries automatically (Professional/Enterprise) or alerts you immediately (all tiers).

### ✅ Testing with Real Data
We don't hand off untested workflows. We run 5-10 real examples through your automation to ensure it works perfectly.

### ✅ Documentation & Training
You get written docs + a Loom video showing exactly how your automation works, how to use it, and how to modify it if needed.

### ✅ Post-Handoff Support
- **Starter:** 7 days of email support
- **Professional:** 30 days of priority email support
- **Enterprise:** 30 days of priority support + weekly check-ins

## FAQ (Pre-emptive Objection Handling)

### Q: How fast can you deliver?
**A: Starter DFY = 48 hours. Professional = 3-4 days. Enterprise = 7 days.**

We don't rush and deliver broken automations. We build, test, and deliver production-ready workflows that work from day 1.

---

### Q: What if I don't know which tools to use?
**A: No problem!** On our kickoff call, we'll audit your current process and recommend the best tools to connect. Most clients use Gmail, Google Sheets, and a CRM (HubSpot, Pipedrive, etc.). We make it work.

---

### Q: Do I need to know how to code?
**A: Absolutely not.** That's the whole point of Done-For-You. You describe the problem, we build the solution. Zero coding required.

---

### Q: What happens after the 7-30 day support period?
**A: Your automation keeps running forever** (it's yours). If you need updates or new workflows later, you can:
- Buy another DFY plan for one-off builds
- Subscribe to our monthly plans for ongoing automation (£29-£299/month)
- Pay for one-off fixes (£49-99 per fix)

---

### Q: Can I modify the automation later?
**A: Yes, you own it 100%.** We build it in your accounts using your tools. You can modify, duplicate, or delete it anytime. We also provide documentation so you (or your team) can tweak it if needed.

---

### Q: What if my automation breaks?
**A: During the support period (7-30 days), we fix it for free.** After that, you can:
- Pay for one-off fixes (£49-99)
- Subscribe for ongoing maintenance (£29+/month)
- Fix it yourself using the documentation we provide

---

### Q: What tools do you support?
**A: We support 100+ tools, including:**
- Email: Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid, Mailchimp
- CRM: HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce, Airtable
- Spreadsheets: Google Sheets, Excel, Airtable
- Messaging: Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, SMS (Twilio)
- Payment: Stripe, PayPal, Gumroad
- Custom APIs: If you have a custom tool, we can connect it

If you're not sure, just ask! We'll tell you if we can build it (99% of the time, we can).

---

### Q: What if I need more than 7 workflows?
**A: Buy DFY Enterprise (7 workflows) + a subscription plan.**

Example:
- **Week 1:** Buy DFY Enterprise (£599) to automate your top 7 pain points immediately.
- **Week 2+:** Subscribe to Growth (£79/month) to build 3 new workflows every month as you scale.

This gives you a fast start + continuous automation expansion.

---

### Q: Can I get a refund?
**A: Yes, we offer a 14-day money-back guarantee.**

If we deliver your automation and it doesn't work as described, we'll either:
1. Fix it immediately (usually within 24 hours), OR
2. Refund you 100%, no questions asked

We've never had to issue a refund because we test everything before handoff. But the guarantee is there for your peace of mind.

---

### Q: How do I know you won't mess up my data?
**A: We work in test/staging environments first, then move to production.**

For DFY builds, we:
1. Ask for read-only access where possible
2. Test with dummy data first
3. Run 5-10 real examples in a sandbox
4. Only move to production after you approve the test results

We also use error handling to ensure if something fails, it doesn't corrupt your data—it just alerts you.

## Who DFY Is Perfect For

### ✅ Solo Founders
You're doing everything yourself. Sales, support, accounting, marketing. Automation gives you 15-20 hours back every week so you can focus on growth.

### ✅ Small Agencies
You're managing 5-10 clients manually. Every client onboarding takes 2 hours. Every report takes 1 hour. Automation scales your agency without hiring.

### ✅ Operations Managers
You're drowning in spreadsheets, manual data entry, and "glue work." Automation eliminates busywork so you can focus on strategy.

### ✅ Non-Technical Teams
You know you need automation, but you don't have a developer. We build it for you—no code required.
