# 🎥 TIKTOK / YOUTUBE SHORTS SCRIPTS

## Overview
5 short-form video scripts (15-30 seconds each) targeting solo founders, small agencies, and creators drowning in manual work. Each script follows: Hook → Problem → Solution → CTA.

**Filming Tips:**
- Use your phone (no fancy equipment needed)
- Film vertical (9:16 ratio)
- Show your face or screen-record your automations running
- Add captions (many people watch without sound)
- Keep it fast-paced (attention span = 3 seconds)
