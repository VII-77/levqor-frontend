# RFP-7: CONVERSION ENGINE

## LEVQOR'S MASTER SALES SCRIPT

### 90-Second Pitch

```
"We build custom automation workflows for businesses—things like syncing your CRM, 
automating reports, or handling lead follow-ups.

The difference between us and Zapier or agencies? 

We do it FOR you. You don't learn anything, you don't build anything. 
You just tell us what you need, and we deliver it in 48 hours.

Pricing is simple: £99 for one workflow, £249 for three, £599 for seven. 
One-time fee. You own it forever. No subscriptions unless you want ongoing support.

We include testing, documentation, and support. 14-day money-back guarantee.

Most people save 10-20 hours per week. Pays for itself in a month.

What are you currently doing manually that you'd like automated?"
```

---

### Discovery Call Flow

**Phase 1: Rapport (1-2 min)**
```
"Hey [Name], thanks for hopping on! Before we dive in, 
tell me a bit about your business—what do you do and who do you serve?"

[Listen, take notes, build connection]
```

**Phase 2: Pain Discovery (3-5 min)**
```
"Got it. So what made you reach out? What's the main thing eating up your time right now?"

Follow-up questions:
• "How much time does that take per week?"
• "What have you tried so far to fix it?"
• "What happens if you don't fix it?"
• "How much is your time worth per hour?"

[Goal: Quantify pain in hours/money]
```

**Phase 3: Solution Presentation (2-3 min)**
```
"Okay, here's what we'd do:

[Describe workflow in simple terms]

This would take you from [X hours] down to [Y minutes].

We'd build this in 48 hours, test it with your data, document it, 
and give you 7 days of support to make sure it works perfectly.

Cost is [£99/£249/£599] one-time. No monthly fees.

Does that sound like it'd solve your problem?"
```

**Phase 4: Objection Handling (2-5 min)**
```
[Address objections—see matrix below]
```

**Phase 5: Close (1-2 min)**
```
"Awesome. Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send you a payment link for [price]
2. You'll fill out a quick form with your workflow details
3. We'll schedule a 30-min kickoff call within 24 hours
4. We build it and deliver in 48 hours

Sound good? I can send that link right now."

[If yes: Send link immediately]
[If hesitant: "What's holding you back?"]
```

### Objection-Handling Matrix

#### Objection 1: "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
```
"I get it—£99 feels like a lot upfront. But let's do the math:

If you're spending 5 hours/week on this task, that's 20 hours/month.

If your time is worth £20/hour (conservative), that's £400/month in lost productivity.

This pays for itself in a week. After that, it's pure profit.

Plus, we have a 14-day guarantee. If it doesn't work, you get a full refund.

Does that change how you're thinking about it?"
```

---

#### Objection 2: "I can do it myself on Zapier"

**Response:**
```
"Totally fair—you absolutely could! 

Here's the thing: most people spend 5-10 hours learning Zapier, building the workflow, 
debugging it when it breaks, and maintaining it.

We do all that in 48 hours for £99. You don't touch it.

So it's really a question of: Do you want to spend your time learning Zapier, 
or would you rather spend £99 and have it done by Friday?

What makes more sense for you?"
```

---

#### Objection 3: "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
```
"Of course! Totally fair. 

Just so I can help you think it through—what specifically are you trying to decide on? 
Is it the price, the timeline, or something else?"

[Listen, then address specific concern]

"Here's what I'd suggest: Let's at least get you scheduled for the kickoff call. 
If you decide it's not right after that, no worries. But that way, 
if you do want to move forward, we're not starting from scratch. 

Does that work?"
```

---

#### Objection 4: "How do I know it'll work?"

**Response:**
```
"Great question. Here's how we guarantee it works:

1. We test it with your real data before delivery
2. We include 7-30 days of support (depending on tier)
3. If it breaks, we fix it for free during the support period
4. 14-day money-back guarantee if you're not happy

We've built 100+ workflows. We know what we're doing.

And honestly, the worst case is you get a refund and keep the workflow. 
There's literally no risk.

Want to move forward?"
```

---

#### Objection 5: "I don't have time for a kickoff call"

**Response:**
```
"Totally understand—you're busy. That's literally why you need automation.

The kickoff call is 30 minutes. We ask you questions, you answer. 
That's it. You don't prep anything.

Without it, we can't build what you actually need. 

Can you find 30 minutes this week? I'll make it as painless as possible."
```

---

#### Objection 6: "What if I need changes later?"

**Response:**
```
"Good question. Here's how that works:

All DFY packages include revisions during the support period 
(7 days for Starter, 30 days for Pro/Enterprise).

After that, small tweaks are usually £25-50. 
Or you can upgrade to a subscription (£29-99/month) and get unlimited changes.

Most people don't need changes because we nail it the first time. 
But if you do, it's easy and cheap.

Does that work for you?"
```

---

#### Objection 7: "Can I see examples first?"

**Response:**
```
"Absolutely. What industry are you in / what are you trying to automate?"

[Send relevant case study or example]

"Here's what we built for [similar business]. Took 2 days, cost £249, 
saved them 15 hours/week.

Would something like this work for you?"
```

---

#### Objection 8: "I'm not tech-savvy"

**Response:**
```
"Perfect—that's exactly who we built this for!

You don't need to be technical. You don't build anything. 
You just tell us what you want in plain English, and we handle the rest.

The whole point is you never have to think about the tech.

That's literally why we exist."
```

---

#### Objection 9: "What if my tools aren't supported?"

**Response:**
```
"We support 100+ tools—Google Sheets, Airtable, Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, 
most CRMs, email platforms, you name it.

What tools are you using?"

[If supported:] "Yep, we integrate with all of those."

[If not supported:] "We can usually work around it with webhooks or APIs. 
Let me confirm and get back to you in 24 hours."
```

---

#### Objection 10: "I need to talk to my team first"

**Response:**
```
"Makes sense. Who else is involved in this decision?"

[Identify decision maker]

"Here's what I'd suggest: Let me send you a one-pager you can share with your team. 
It has pricing, timeline, examples—everything they'd need to know.

Can you have a decision by [specific date]? That way we can get started this week."

[Send one-pager, follow up on agreed date]
```
